    "body": "Benchmark market indices tumbled sharply on Monday, dragged lower byheavy selling in information technology (IT) countersafter the Donald Trump-led US administration announced a steep hike in H-1B visa application fees. The S&P BSE Sensex was down 503.31 points at 82,122.92 by 2:55 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 slipped 143.80 points to 25,183.20. Volatility surged across broader market segments, with most indices in the red. The Nifty IT index slumped over 3%, leading the fall on Dalal Street. Tech giants including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech and Tech Mahindra bore the brunt of the selloff, as investors priced in the potential hit to margins from the US decision to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. While the shock announcement from President Trump clearly rattled sentiment, analysts say the selloff reflects more than just visa concerns. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, told India Today that the Indian IT sector has been battling a combination of pressures. “While the shock fromPresident Trump’s H-1B fee announcementclearly hit sentiment and triggered a panic in the Indian IT sector, the weakness actually runs deeper and is multi-faceted. Beyond visa costs, the sector has been grappling with a structural slowdown in project spending from international clients and slower deal closures,” Singhania said. He added that the majority of Indian IT revenue still comes from the US market, making it highly sensitive to both tariffs and regulatory shocks. “With tariffs already a major blow to export-related sectors including IT, clients have been cautious in spending on new projects. The H-1B has only added to the uncertainty related to margin pressure for ITs,” he noted. The sudden fall in IT shares has left investors questioning their strategy. According to Singhania, existing shareholders should remain calm and avoid knee-jerk selling. “For investors already holding IT stocks, the sensible approach is to remain calm and avoid hurried selling. The industry is under strain from factors such as regulatory uncertainty and reduced client spending, yet these pressures do not take away from its broader importance in global technology services,” he said. He added that patience with well-managed companies could prove rewarding in the long run, though recovery may take time. “Long-term portfolios can hold patiently, but if exposure is high, partial profit booking might be taken into consideration. The key is to remain watchful of sector commentary, deal wins, and demand outlook.” For those eyeing fresh investments in IT stocks, Singhania advised caution. “For new investors, adopting a wait-and-watch approach would be beneficial. The IT industry is going through a phase of change, with shifting client demand and policy uncertainties still unfolding,” he explained. However, he noted that long-term structural drivers remain intact. “Trends like cloud, digital, and AI adoption are not going away. The current weakness eventually could offer attractive entry points. Gradual accumulation and spreading investments would enable investors to participate in the sector’s eventual recovery while also limiting the risk of catching steep downside and losses.” The sharp fall in IT stocks highlighted the fragility of market sentiment at a time when global policy risks are converging with structural challenges in India’s largest export sector. While the H-1B visa fee shock served as a trigger, analysts warn that the pressure on margins and deal flow could keep the sector under stress in the near term. For investors, the turbulence is a reminder of the importance of patience, diversification, and close attention to global policy shifts that can ripple through Dalal Street in a single session.",
