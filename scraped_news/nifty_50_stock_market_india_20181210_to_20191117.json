    "title": "Nearly 50% of Nifty companies trading at a discount; should you buy or stay put?",
    "body": "Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations. About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These includeTata Steel,ONGC,Coal India,NTPC,JSW Steel,IOC,Gail India,Axis Bank,Power Grid, among others. Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether? Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks. A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment. The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time. “We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said. Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names? “One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol. “Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said. How relevant are long term averages? Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts. The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages. “Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol. “It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

    "title": "Market Highlights: Sensex plunges 770 points, Nifty settles below 10,800-level",
    "body": "The Indian equity market on Tuesday closed amid macroeconomic data, auto sales number and global cues. Sensex closed 769.88 points, or 2.06%, at 36,562.91 while the broader Nifty settled at 10,797.90 tumbling 225.35 points, or 2.04%. Investors were worried on economy slowdown, GDP data and merger of the the PSU Banks announced late on Friday. Also, the auto sales data which was released over the weekend likely to increase the nervousness of the Dalal Street. \"Market slid as deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. The consolidation of PSU banks is a step in right direction however, they may take more time before earning benefits from synergy. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflow from foreign investors added volatility to rupee,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. In the broader market, both the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices slipped 1.65% and 1.32% respectively. ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank and Vedanta were the worst performing stocks, crashing as much as 4.45%. On NSE, 48 out of 50 stocks ended in the red zone with Tata Steel and UltraTech Cement taking the top position among the losers. Only Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies were the gainers on the 50-share index. “The sharp fall in the Q1 GDP growth to 5% and the weak core sector growth are the key factors that have caused a fall in the markets as it opened after a long weekend. The continuing negative global cues, the raging tariff war between the US and China, and the likely sluggishness in the economic fortunes of economies around the world have also been behind the rot in the markets here as well as elsewhere. Weak domestic consumption especially rural consumption has resulted mainly from low employment levels and non-availability of finance, which are issues that call for immediate measures to salvage the situation,” said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research- Emkay Wealth Management. Among sectors, Nifty PSU Banks was the biggest loser, falling 4.87%, followed by Metal (-3.10%), Media (-2.59%), Private Banks (-2.34%) and Financial Services (-2.28%).

Sensex closed 769.88 points, or 2.06%, at 36,562.91 while the broader Nifty settled at 10,797.90 tumbling 225.35 points, or 2.04%. The 30-share index plunged 802 points, or 2.15%, to 36,529.83. Nifty PSU Bank sector is down 4.73% with Indian Bank (-10.88%) taking the pole position among top losers followed by Canara Bank (-10.29%), Union Bank (-8.33%), Punjab National Bank (-8.24%) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (7.07%). Midcap stocks continue to decline. BSE Midcap index is trading 1.55% lower with Indian Bank (10.84%) being the top loser. “Cabinet clears recapitalization of IDBI Bank with one-time infusion of funds by both Government and LIC.

Gold has historically been a favoured asset class for Indians but billionaire banker Uday Kotak believes there should be a new policy that will reset investor priority to equity, a more productive asset than the precious metal. Kotak said in a series of tweets on Monday why pouring Indians’ savings into gold was not good for the health of India’s economy.

Markets already had rallied on Monday and today after the trends started confirming BJP's win Sensex and Nifty hit their new highs. But now the market will have to catch up with ground realities of the economy and global factors. Global markets are showing weakness due to US-China trade worries and so our market may settle down or even turn negative in the short term. Traders must stay cautious now. Looking at technicals, Nifty has support around 11,730 levels, breaching it on downside might result in more downside towards 11,600, On the upside, any close above 11,800 may take the Nifty above 12,000.

Rising markets make the stocks expensive, and hence it would be not the right time to jump in. Nevertheless, it is also recommended that investors hold on to their investments and wait for their financial goals to achieve. My expectations from the new government for the Mutual Fund Industry are – Scheme portability – The option to switch from one AMC scheme to another AMC scheme within the same asset class should be made available to investors without any extra cost & tax incidence. FOF as Equity Scheme – Revise the definition of “Equity Oriented Funds” (EOF) by including Fund of Funds (FOF) schemes which invest predominantly i.e., 65% or more, in units of Equity Oriented Mutual Fund Schemes. Taxation – Taxation of Fixed Income products and bonds if transacted in the capital market to be similar. Pension Funds – Mutual Funds to be permitted along with tax benefit, management of pension funds. Economy – Fiscal deficit to be controlled and financial discipline to be instilled without falling prey to populist measures.\" 14:03 (IST) 23 May 2019 Nifty PSU Bank index up over 1.5 per cent, top gainers and losers among the PSU banks The Nifty PSU Bank index on the National Stock Exchange is up over 1.5 per cent.

(Source: Comapny release to BSE) 12:51 (IST) 23 May 2019 Surendra Hiranandani, Founder and Director, House of Hiranandani on real estate sector: The real estate sector was in the news in the last couple of years, with the government announcing several major policy initiatives like demonetization, RERA, GST etc which changed the entire landscape of the industry and made it buyer friendly. Housing remains the top priority for every Indian regardless of their income levels, education or any other possible factor and we believe that a stable government at the centre in 2019 will further boost the growth in the sector. We hope that the new government demonstrates concrete action to push investments, increase growth and generate employment. We expect that the new government can do away with unnecessary documentation which will help real estate players immensely. It is important that single window clearance is soon put into practice which will not only resolve operational issues prevalent in the industry but would improve the productivity of the real estate industry. Currently, the permissions are coming at a snail’s pace. Private sector participation in housing is necessary to bridge the gap between demand and supply and for that it is desirable to create a policy framework to minimise and simplify approvals required for the development of a real estate project. Real Estate sector stands amongst the critical sectors in terms of investments and employment and we look forward to initiatives that would further aid to the growth of the sector in the near future. 12:43 (IST) 23 May 2019 Japan's Nippon Life Insurance to raise stake in Reliance Capital-owned asset manager to 75 per cent Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management said on Thursday its Japanese investor would increase its stake in the Mumbai-based asset manager to 75 per cent.

Consistency in leadership is a positive for the economy overall and should shore up sentiment amongst foreign investors. This could lead to Rupee strengthening and benchmark yields coming down over the short term. Specific to the Indian stock market; we believe they might have run up ahead of fundamentals buoyed by sentiment over the short term.

Nascent signs have appeared, even though an enduring setback is not yet visible. The Reserve Bank of India reported, recently, that credit quality deteriorated in June 2019, with rise in stressed and NPA ratios in all sectors except industry (Monetary Policy Report, October). Although the central bank did not provide numbers, charted trend shows the gross NPA ratio closer to 10% from 9.3% in March, which represented a four-quarter successive decline.

Adding, he said that the insurer sees plenty of high growth from here despite the ongoing slowdown in the economy, ET Now reported. LIC has seen slowdown cycles before as well and it will ride over it too, LIC Chairman added. Even as the slowdown has hit the insurance sector, LIC has done well as against the private sector peers and also managed to get some of the lost market share in the smaller cities, MK Kumar noted. Full story 13:45 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Portfolio Management Services (PMS) vs MF: How both investments have fared in 5 years In the last five years, Mutual Fund sector has seen a “spectacular growth” due to a combination of increasing awareness, rising markets, Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)’s marketing campaigns, advancement of various new-age distributors.

Full story 12:36 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Monsoon effect: Late kharif harvesting may hit rabi sowing and output Barring bajra, moong and sunflower, market arrivals of all other kharif crops are now lower than a year ago mainly due to late sowing during the monsoon season and excess rains in September. If this trend continues for a longer while, the sowing of key rabi crops like wheat, mustard and chana may get delayed, potentially bringing down their yield as northern India has been witnessing above-normal temperature from March, the month when rabi harvesting commences, during the past few years.

Regulations and compliances have, however, become stricter in recent times.

An RD is like an account into which one needs to invest the same amount each month for a fixed period. In banks, one can open RD account for any period, however, in a post office, an RD can be opened for a fixed period of 5 years only. Currently, the interest rate on the post office recurring deposit (PO RD) is higher than what most banks offer on their 5-year bank RD scheme. In SBI and HDFC Bank, the recurring deposit rate of interest are 6.25 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively.

Vodafone Idea Ltd., formed by last year’s merger of the British telecommunications firm’s local unit with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd., has warned lenders that it won’t be able to honor its commitments for long under current conditions, the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private. One of its requests was a temporary halt to loan payments, although no formal proposal has been made, two of the people said. Full story 11:15 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Letâ€™s get realistic about BSNL revival Ever since the press critiqued the government’s Rs 70,000 crore bailout package for BSNL-MTNL, BSNL supporters have called it ill-informed, and one-sided; it does not, for instance, take into account the tens of thousands of crores of private telecom debt that PSU banks will have to write off. Indeed, if the debt owed by telcos to the government is added, the figure could runs into lakhs of crores; while companies like RCom and Aircel are already in the insolvency courts, many believe Vodafone-Idea is running out of funds to sustain operations. And, after the Supreme Court judgment on AGR, you can add another Rs 1.33 lakh crore to private sector telecom debt. Put that way, the argument is a sound one: why is writing off private sector debt okay, but a bailout for the public sector problematic? Full story 11:06 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 OYO, MMT under scanner after industry body complains; CCI orders probe Competition watchdog CCI has ordered an investigation against hospitality company OYO and online travel agency Go-MMT after industry body FHRAI filed a complaint alleging unfair business practices and destroying competition. The Competition Commission of India also said that there was a prima facie case for investigation against Ritesh Agarwal-founded OYO and Go-MMT, the entity made after the merger of GoIbibo and MakeMyTrip. The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) alleged that the “opposite parties have abused their respective dominant positions, they have cartelized and further, they have entered into anti-competitive agreements/agreements,” CCI note said. Full story 10:54 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Population grows at double pace than jobs in India; rural employment remains stagnant Ever since the results of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2017-18 became public — they showed that unemployment in India was at a 45-year high — there has been a vigorous public debate about the true state of unemployment in the country. What has fueled this debate — and allowed different people to arrive at differing conclusions about the state of unemployment — has been the long delays in the availability of past employment data, even though PLFS tracks employment annually. Full story 10:47 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Bank employees salary negotiation: What has stalled a settlement for over two years A wage revision settlement for over 10 lakh bank employees and officers has been stuck for two years due to serious differences between the bank management and unions. According to banking industry sources, though there was a broad agreement over the Indian Banking Association’s offer of a 12% hike in the wage cost but the talks were derailed for over a year as four officers associations wanted the inclusion of bank officers of all seven scales in the proposed settlement. In addition to this, now a majority of unions and associations are not willing to accept less than 15% hike which was the case with the last wage revision settlement that was applicable for a period of five years, from 2012 to 2017. Full story 10:33 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Govt forms high-level panel to look at bailout package for Airtel, Vodafone Idea, other telcos The government has constituted a committee of secretaries to explore a financial bailout package for the telecom sector by lowering spectrum charges as well as ending the era of free mobile phone calls and dirt cheap data as companies look at the government for avoiding payment of thousands of crores of rupees in overdue statutory levies. The Committee of Secretaries, headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, has been asked to examine “all aspects” of “financial stress” faced by service providers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea and suggest measures to mitigate them, sources in the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said. Full story 10:29 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Input Tax Credit: New GST refund rules create confusion as deadline to file first returns comes close Millions of GST payers are eagerly awaiting clarity over the new rules notified early this month that restricted the refund of input tax credit to 20% of the total claimed amount. The GST registered businesses will begin uploading their returns from next week and it will be the first occasion when they will file their returns under the new rules governing the refund of the input tax credit. On October 9, the GST council notified new rules under section 43 of the GST law that restricts the refund amount to 20% of the claimed amount if the suppliers have not uploaded correct details in the GSTR 1 form uploaded on GSTN portal. Businesses are expected to face challenges this month onwards due to the lack of clarity on the applicability of this rule, said Pritam Mahure, a Mumbai based Chartered Accountant. Full story 10:28 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Several panels later, Indiaâ€™s export sector a laggard, cries for bold policy push Even as the government is set to release the report of a high-level advisory group under noted economist Surjit Bhalla on ways to boost exports, recommendations of similar panels in the past have hardly been implemented. Inadequate government action has often rendered the practice of setting up panels largely irrelevant, while the country’s export growth continues to remain below par and miss targets frequently. Various committees, working groups, inter-ministerial pa-nels have, in the past, suggested steps to address structural hurdles,including elevated logistics costs, inflexible labour laws and inverted/distorted duty structure (especially in textiles), whi-ch continue to cripple India’s ex-port competitiveness. Archaic labour laws have long militated against firms acquiring size and scale in critical jobs-intensive se-ctors, while logistics costs make up for as much as 15-16% of exporters’ consignment value. Full story 10:11 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Bond vigilantes in India worry too much, must trust Modi administration, says IDBI banker Ashok Gautam is betting that India will achieve its fiscal deficit target this year. That makes him something of a rare breed among investors in the nation’s bond market. Gautam, a banker for nearly thirty-five years, is counting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s administration’s past fiscal-track record, which shows it can generate funds to plug revenue gaps. That, he said, would remove a major impediment to a debt rally, which could see the benchmark 10-year yield slip to near a three-year low as the Reserve Bank of India cuts rates further. Full story 09:59 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 RCEP: Ball squarely in PM Modiâ€™s court With barely a week left for countries to make their positions clear on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the ball lies in Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s court, as he will take the final call on whether India would be part of the mega regional trade deal or not, sources told FE. A leaders’ summit, to be attended by the heads of the 16 RCEP nations, is scheduled to be held in Bangkok next week, where the deal was supposed to be announced. The deal faces fierce domestic resistance from not just industries, including steel and dairy, but also the government departments overseeing these sectors, thanks to persisting fears of dumping by countries like China. Full story 09:43 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Competition act: Regulator orders probe against MakeMyTrip-Ibibo and OYO The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has stated in an order dated October 28 that there is a prima facie case for investigation against MakeMyTrip India-Ibibo Group (MMT-Go) and Oravel Stays (OYO) for alleged violations of the Competition Act. The order is in response to a complaint filed by the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI). The CCI said that there is a prima facie case for investigation against MMT-Go and OYO for alleged violation of the provisions of Section 3(4) of the Act, which deals with anti-competitive agreements. A prima facie case for investigation under Section 4 of the Act, which deals with abuse of dominant position, has also been made out against MMT-Go. The CCI has sought a report on the investigation within 150 days.

Guidance was maintained as it expects to remain profitable in seasonally stronger H2. Losses were higher than expected in India business partly due to a Rs 230-crore write-off in PV business. Tata Sons plans to infuse Rs 6,500 crore of equity into Tata Motors, which should support the balance sheet, given rising leverage.

PPOP was in line with a positive NII, offset by higher-than-expected opex. Granular slippages normalised and corporate stress formation was also low at Rs 3,400 crore. The watch list (standard IBC + SMA 1/2) is at Rs 26,000 crore (1.2% of loans); including one more large HFC and a telecom group, we estimate the total stress pool at 2.2% of loans, which looks manageable to us now. Full story 09:01 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Insolvency Code progress report: Nearly 4 times as many cases in liquidation as in resolution In over three years of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the number of bankrupt companies liquidated under the regime has far exceeded the number of corporate resolutions, by nearly four times, somewhat defying the actual purpose of the new system.

Full story 08:56 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Several panels later, Indiaâ€™s export sector a laggard, cries for bold policy push Even as the government is set to release the report of a high-level advisory group under noted economist Surjit Bhalla on ways to boost exports, recommendations of similar panels in the past have hardly been implemented. Inadequate government action has often rendered the practice of setting up panels largely irrelevant, while the country’s export growth continues to remain below par and miss targets frequently. Various committees, working groups, inter-ministerial pa-nels have, in the past, suggested steps to address structural hurdles,including elevated logistics costs, inflexible labour laws and inverted/distorted duty structure (especially in textiles), whi-ch continue to cripple India’s ex-port competitiveness. Archaic labour laws have long militated against firms acquiring size and scale in critical jobs-intensive se-ctors, while logistics costs make up for as much as 15-16% of exporters’ consignment value.
