    "body": "This Article is From Dec 23, 2018 Indian Stock Market Now Bigger Than Germany's India edged past the equity market of Europes largest economy for the first time in seven years Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email The move reflects India's positive returns this year. India's ascent on the global stage has claimed another victory after its stock market overtook Germany to become the seventh largest in the world. India edged past the equity market of Europe's largest economy for the first time in seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That means, after the UK leaves the European Union in March, the bloc would have only one country -- France -- among the seven biggest markets. India and Germany's market capitalization The move reflects India's positive returns this year as companies' reliance on domestic demand enabled them to avoid the meltdown in other emerging markets spurred by Federal Reserve tightening and a trade war between the U.S. and China. It also highlights the challenges facing the EU, including its future relationship with the UK, a standoff with Italy over budget allocations and separatist clashes in Spain. While the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is heading for a 17 per cent decline this year, India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent after seesawing throughout the year amid oil-price volatility. India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent In a year dominated by trade protectionism and punitive tariffs by Donald Trump's administration on China, it's little wonder that investors have turned cautious over countries with a heavy dependence on exports. Germany derives more than 38 per cent of its gross domestic product from exports, based on 2017 data from World Bank. The corresponding ratio for India is only 11 per cent, meaning much of the stock-market opportunity in the country comes from domestic consumer stories. Add NDTV As A Trusted Source The reliance on local demand and entrepreneurship also puts India ahead in growth sweepstakes. The south Asian nation is projected to grow 7.5 per cent this year and 7.3 per cent in 2019, a far cry from German growth of 1.6 per cent for each year.

India’s stock market has become accustomed to foreign investors serving as a reliable engine of funds, with a net $59bn of money flowing in over the past six years. But so far this year that trend has reversed, with the market on course for its first year of net foreign outflows since 2011 — contributing to a hefty decline in the value of the rupee as the currency has plumbed to its weakest level versus the US dollar in recent weeks. Yet amid the foreign selling, India’s Nifty 50 stock index has climbed to a succession of record highs this year. Up 7 per cent in the year to date, the market remains near its all-time peak even after a softening in late August. These contrasting movements are the latest sign of the Indian stock market being increasingly driven by domestic investment, while foreign investors have a less powerful role to play, despite their broadly positive view on the country’s economic outlook. For centuries, Indian households have kept their savings overwhelmingly in property and gold. However, growing financial literacy, coupled with reduced fears of inflation, is now driving a surge of domestic money into the stock market. Indian equity mutual funds had net inflows of Rs780bn ($10.7bn) in the first eight months of this year, according to industry trade group AMFI, easily outweighing the net selling of Rs59bn by foreign equity investors. The domestic buying has driven the Indian market’s valuation to unusually high levels, noted Mahesh Nandurkar, Indian equity strategist at CLSA. On a price-to-earnings basis, the Nifty now enjoys a 60 per cent premium to the emerging markets average, he estimated. It is concerned about overheated valuations, rather than India’s economic outlook, that have caused foreign investors to pare their exposure to Indian stocks, said Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers. “The role that foreign investors used to play has been taken over by domestic investors,” he said. “And that has pushed valuations to a level where foreign investors don’t feel comfortable.” But foreign selling in India’s debt market has been even larger, with net outflows of Rs443bn in the first eight months of the year amid tightening US monetary policy. That pushed the 10-year government bond yield this week to 8.14 per cent, its highest level since 2014, while sending the rupee to a record low of Rs72.97 to the dollar. The rupee’s slide has prompted foreign equity investors such as Robert Secker, at M&G Investments, to focus more on sectors such as IT services, which benefit because their revenues are mostly earned abroad and their costs are largely domestic. Shares in the largest of these companies, Tata Consultancy Services, have risen 66 per cent alone in the past year, against 11 per cent for the Nifty as a whole. And while the rupee’s slide has depressed foreign investors’ Indian returns in dollar terms, Mr Secker added, the country’s domestically focused economy means it is seen as a relative safe haven at a time when investors are worrying about emerging trade wars. India has its own trade headaches — notably its heavy reliance on imported oil, where rising prices have been a key factor behind the growing current account deficit that has helped sap the rupee’s value. Other metrics look more promising, said Sunny Ng, a fund manager at PineBridge Investments, highlighting the country’s “stellar” economic growth of 8.2 per cent in the second quarter. Some recent policy changes have also boosted sentiment, he added, such as a new bankruptcy code that should help boost credit growth by giving added protections to lenders. In contrast, Indian regulators recently sparked outrage by announcing rules that barred entities owned by Indian-origin people from acting as foreign portfolio investors. An advisory panel has since advised the regulator to reconsider the move, but no reversal has yet been announced. “Whenever the stock market is roaring, the regulators tend to adopt an attitude that we don’t really need foreigners and their money,” Mr Mukherjea said. But while such heavy-handed interventions may unsettle foreign investors, he added, the soaring valuations driven by domestic inflows were having a more meaningful restraining effect on overseas investment. “Foreign investors face a richly valued market at a time when [other emerging markets] have pulled back 20 per cent,” he said. “So if you’re sitting in London, you’ll be hard pressed to explain to your CEO why you’re pumping money into India.” Reuse this content (opens in new window) Comments Jump to comments section Promoted Content Latest on India Behind the Money podcast 23 min listen The unsustainable boom in India’s Silicon Valley India Business Briefing Pakistan, protests and public opinion: Narendra Modi's terrible year Premium content Artificial intelligence Global AI giants target India’s youth in emerging market push India Business Briefing Nandan Nilekani: AI will transform Indian education and agriculture Premium content News in-depth Indian business & finance India’s polo-playing steel tycoon behind bid for Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit US immigration Trump’s H-1B visa turmoil threatens Indians’ American dream FT News Briefing podcast 11 min listen Oracle’s leadership shake-up India Business Briefing Not quite a death knell: India’s tech sector and Trump’s new H-1B rules Premium content Follow the topics in this article Currencies Add to myFT Asia-Pacific equities Add to myFT Indian business & finance Add to myFT Emerging market investing Add to myFT Equities Add to myFT Comments",

    "title": "Global markets wobbled while Indian indices produced a higher return",
    "body": "Investors found that when world stock markets were volatile, India's two indices showed calm with a good return. Historical return, volatility earnings ratio data of last year showed that Indian Stock Market was doing well with respect to various international counterparts including Europe's FTSE and USA's Nasdaq indices. India's most vibrant index Nifty produced 12.18 per cent in a year (as on May 31, 2019). At the same time, global stock markets had been struck with various factors, including slowing world economy, less support from central banks and trade tensions. In this period, Hang Seng index of Hong Kong recorded negative 13.07 per cent followed by Singapore Strait Times index (-10.17 per cent), Japan's Nikkei (-9.21 per cent), Europe' FTSE (-7.49 per cent) and Nasdaq (-2.02 per cent). However, USA's DOW index registered only 0.01 per cent return for the period of June 2018 to May 2019. Investors always look at three factors to balance their investment decisions - returns, volatility and price-earnings ratio; all these factors have favoured Indian indices. Annualised volatility data shows that India's stock indices are less volatile than the world's top stock markets, including the USA'S Nasdaq and China's Shanghai Composite Index. China Shanghai Composite Index is the highest volatile market. Annualised volatility for June, 2018 to May, 2019, the Shanghai Composite index witnessed 21.5 per cent volatility followed by US Nasdaq (19.4 per cent). \"Chinese equity markets are no strangers to large swings. Long-term measures of volatility indicate annual levels near 33 per cent and 54 per cent for offshore and onshore markets respectively\" (based on quarterly data), Standard Chartered Bank said in its global market outlook. The Indian indices -- Sensex and Nifty -- recorded the lowest annualised volatility to 12.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent, respectively, for the period of June, 2018 to May, 2019. \"The performance of Indian capital market compares favourably with the other major global economies on various parameters such as indices returns, volatility and currency movements,\" Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, SEBI, India's capital market regulator said. India also ranked top in the criteria of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which gives an idea to investors that index is over or undervalued. Higher P/E means that higher earnings expectations in the future compared to lower P/E. Indian market recorded top rank in terms of P/E. Nifty P/E ratio at 29.5, which was the highest across the world indices during June, 2018 to May, 2019, Sebi data shows. The growing financial integration with fast cross-border mobility of private capital inflows leads the rally in Indian market experts said that shift in the leverage preference of companies from debt to equity finance. Rajiv Singh, CEO, Karvy stock broking Ltd explains to India Today that \"post demonetisation, domestic inflows have become more robust and domestic institutions have stepped in whenever FII's have sold. The trade war has helped as India is thought of as a safe haven among peers. Lastly, subdued oil prices have helped Indian markets perform better than other EM's\". India has outperformed peers on account of multiple reasons, firstly, the election of a stable reform-oriented government, coupled with the long term growth story for Indian equities has made India an attractive destination for global investors. India has outperformed emerging markets by 5.5 per cent in the last one year, of which 4.5 per cent rally occurred on the day after exit polls were announced. FII inflows are the reason why index heavyweights like HDFC, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Fin, Bajaj Finserve, Reliance, TCS have done well, whereas the broader market has been weak, Rajiv said.",

    "body": "The stock market recovered by half its morning losses as fears gave way to calm in the wake of the Indian attack on posts of Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad. The 30-share BSE Sensex was down 170 points at 1320 IST in today’s session, after having been down over 300 points earlier. As against only four shares being up in the morning, 11 were in the green more than half-way through the session. Tata Motors was the top gainer with a rise of 2.8%, followed by Tata Consultancy Services at 2%. All indices are in the red in today’s trade as investors were spooked by reports that Indian fighter jets had entered Pakistan in the wee hours and destroyed training camps, killing 200-300 terrorists. The BSE Sensex touched a low of 35,714.16 in the ongoing session. According to ANI, the Indian Air Force’s Mirage 2000 fighter jets bombed Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area at 0330 IST. The attack comes 12 days after a bomber belonging to Pakistani terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad killed 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force. As per reports, the terror launch pads of the banned outfit were completely destroyed in the attack. The Indian jets are reported to have returned safely without there being any casualty. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told mediapersons that civilian casualties were avoided, adding that the Indian side had information that the JeM planned more attacks and hence this response had become unavoidable. The strike assumes significance because this is the first time India has used its air force for a pre-emptive strike inside Pakistan. The IAF has put on high alert all air defence systems along the international border and the Line of Control to respond to any possible action by the Pakistan air force.
