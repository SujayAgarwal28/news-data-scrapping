    "body": "Benchmark index S&P BSE Sensexhit an all-time high during intraday trade on Wednesday, surpassing the previous peak it achieved in 2022. In December 2022, the Sensex achieved its previous all-time high of 63,583.07. The 30-share index rose over 260 points to hit a fresh all-time high of 63,588.31 in early trade but fell shortly after due to selling pressure. The NSE Nifty 50 is also eyeing a fresh record and was roughly 30 points away from achieving the milestone at around 1:40 pm. So, what's driving the bull run on Dalal Street? Both benchmark indices have been gaining over the past few months, driven by a host of macroeconomic factors such as lower inflation and stronger growth projections. Persistent foreign inflows have also been a key factor in boosting the domestic benchmark indices. It may be noted that foreign investors have put in over 73 lakh crore so far this financial year. Compared to this, foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the two previous financial years. V.L.A. Ambala (SEBI Registered Research Analyst), Stock Market Today (SMT), said, \"It is another record day in India's stock market. As we had said yesterday, the price was getting ready for a new all-time high, and today Sensex has made a new all-time high of 63,588.31.\" \"We are still in a bull run and the trend is very steep. Fundamentally strong and financially stable stocks are seeing an increase in their volumes,\" she added. Meanwhile, Gaurav Dua, senior vice president and head of capital market strategy at Sharekhan, told news agency Reuters that the Indian economy is in a multi-year upcycle, which is a major positive. \"While there are pockets of overvaluation, pockets of opportunity also exist in markets,\" said Dua. \"The indexes may be at or near record highs, but the valuations are not, thanks to healthy earnings growth over the past 20 months,\" he added. One of the key reasons behind the bull run can be attributed to a sharp acceleration in India's economic growth in the March quarter, in addition to a sharp drop in inflation. With this, the country remains on track to be the fastest-growing economy in the world. Analysts said that the fundamentals of the domestic stocks remain strong, but it is better to wait and watch as upcoming events could provide cues for the future. \"I must say just wait and watch for some time. Right now, I do not see any reason to sell the price except that we are near to an all-time high, so hold it until there is no signal of profit booking,\" Ambala said. \"To be more specific, 62,000 is a strong support level for this bullish movement and if the price sustains at the current range, we will be proudly witnessing Sensex trade in the 65,000 to 75,000 range in this financial year,\" she added. \"Keep in mind that as an economy, we are attracting global interest, and that is a positive side for us,\" she added.
