The Nifty plunged to a three-month low. 09:15 (IST) 04 Oct 2018 Dollar lifted by yield surge, Asia stocks slugged The dollar notched an 11-month top on the yen on Thursday as stunningly strong U.S. economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011, while Asian stocks were pressured as borrowing costs rose at home, said a Reuters report. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. Bond prices fell across Asia and long-term Japanese yields reached ground not visited since early 2016, a market tightening not warranted by domestic economic conditions. 09:14 (IST) 04 Oct 2018 Market Pre-open: Sensex down 155 points, Nifty below 10,800; rupee at fresh record low of 73.76/$ Sensex live: The BSE Sensex plunged 155.10 points or 0.43% to 35,820.53 points in the pre-open trade session on Thursday.

    "title": "India’s stock market skyrockets the most in 10 years after surprise tax cut",
    "body": "Indian stocks surged overnight Friday after the country’s government announced a big cut to India’s corporate tax rate. The India S&P BSE Sensex index jumped 5.3% to notch its biggest one-day gain since May 5, 2009. That day, the index soared 17.3%. The U.S.-listed iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA) gained about 5.3%, its best day since Sept. 4, 2013, when it popped 5.5%. Corporations in India will now be taxed at aneffective rate of 25.17%, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Friday. That’s down from an effective tax rate of 30%. The lower corporate tax rate comes as the Indian government tries to reignite India’s economy. India’s GDP growth rate has fallen for six straight quarters through the first half of 2019. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, the Indian economy was growing at an 8.1% rate. That growth rate has since fallen to 5% through the second quarter of this year. “It was becoming evident that counter-cyclical policy responses may need to become more aggressive, but expectations were centered on monetary policy to do the heavy lifting,” Kaushik Das, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. “Very few expected any fiscal stimulus.” “This is a big bang reform, for which corporate India has been waiting a long time and we expect it will raise the animal spirits in the economy,” Das said. Indian stocks have lagged the broader emerging markets this year. The Sensex is up 5.4% in 2019, while the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) has gained about 7% in that time. “The tax cuts will undoubtedly boost sentiment, and that is likely to have a growth-enhancing impact,” Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note. “However, how much investment firms will undertake in response to the tax cut remains to be seen, especially given weak demand conditions.” — CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

    "body": "July 2019 turns out to be the worst in 17 years for Nifty and Sensex August 1, 2019 Up next Published on 01 August 2019 Author Vineeth N C Tags BSE , FPI , NSE Nifty , Sensex Share article The post has been shared by 0 people. Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Pinterest 0 Mail 0 The Indian stock markets recorded their worst July performance in 17 years as Sensex and Nifty went down by 4.86% and 5.69% respectively. This slump in the benchmark indices reminds us of the depreciation that happened in July 2002, when Sensex fell by 7.92%. The Indian equity market was under immense pressure in July as the Union Budget 2019-20 did not address any of the investors’ concerns, which resulted in the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pressing the selling button. Also, the downward movements that Sensex and Nifty recorded were the sharpest monthly decline since October 2018. Inopportune budget amendments, economic slowdown, liquidity crunch, and reduced consumption are the primary reasons for the fall. Also Read: Government and policymakers left with concerns as FPIs continue selling The Indian capital market attracted FPIs when the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty exceeded their record levels of 40,000 and 12,000 points respectively in May. This is when the post-poll survey predicted the return of the BJP-led government. The FPIs infused a whopping Rs 10,384.54 crore in June, they were citing favourable amendments but were let down by Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister of India, in her maiden Budget presented on 5 July 2019. The FPIs have gone into a rigorous selling mood since the second week of July, they have pulled nearly Rs 3,800 crore, which is the highest among the emerging markets in July. Emerging markets such as Thailand and South Korea have received a steady FPI inflow in July 2019. The downfall of the Indian markets at the time when the rupee is up by 0.34% and downward movement in the crude prices is a worrisome factor for the Indian Government and policymakers. The most significant reason for the FPIs to pull out of the Indian capital market is the increase in surcharge on FPIs registered as association and trusts. The Union Budget 2019-20 hiked the tax outgo of the super-rich which has made them consider the newly elected government look more aligned towards the left.

It seems that RBI must have intervened at the yearly projection levels.

Metals and Bank stocks showed signs of short covering, which is positive for the market as these stocks have very high beta and can change the momentum of the market. Today, number of FMCG stocks closed lower against the rise in metals and Banks that could be big positive for the market as it implies that investors are ready to shift from defensive sector to high risk sectors or investors are ready to handle risk in the market. Technically, below the level of 10,850 we were expecting 10,740 and 10,630, however, Nifty got arrested at 10,740 and recovered back to day’s highest level, which was at 10,840.

    "title": "What’s driving the investor bet on Sensex stocks",
    "body": "Minttakes a look at what is driving the stock market. 1)Are the current levels of the stock market justified? Till now, in fiscal 2019-20, the price-to-earnings (P-E) ratio of the 30 shares that constitute the BSE Sensex, India’s most popular stock market index, has been at 28.17. The P-E ratio is the market price of a share divided by its earnings per share. When investors buy a share at a certain price, they are basically paying for the future earnings of that company. So far this fiscal, investors have paid₹28.17 on an average for every rupee of earning for Sensex shares. This is the highest average P-E ratio in more than 20 years. Thus, it’s important to understand what exactly the stock market is paying for. 2)Why are investors paying such a high price for shares? A high P-E ratio means that while share prices are going up, earnings of firms are not. People investing in the stock market hope that as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a bigger majority this time, his government will initiate another round of reforms on labour, land and capital. These reforms will improve ease of doing business. This will help companies expand businesses and spur the launch of several new businesses, thus creating jobs. The creation of more jobs will help people earn more, leading to greater spending, which will benefit businesses and improve their earnings. 3)Have P-E ratios ever been so high in the past? P-E ratios were high in mid-2000, when the dotcom bubble was on, and in December 2007 and early January 2008, when the market was rallying, before the financial crisis set in. 4)What are the other reasons for such a strong market? In the last decade, the central banks of Western countries, led by the Federal Reserve of the US, have followed an easy-money policy. This allowed foreign investors to borrow money at low interest rates in the West, buy shares all over the world and drive up share prices in the process. In the last few months, the Federal Reserve has more or less signalled that this easy money policy is likely to continue. This has given further hope to stock market investors in India. 5)What about the consumption slowdown? Investors expect the new government to tackle the consumption slowdown by raising its spending. This is a short-term hope that has driven up the stock market, despite lack of earnings growth of firms. The government needs to avoid the mistakes made in 2008-09, when it increased spending and pushed public sector banks to run an easy credit policy. This later led to high inflation and massive bad loans of those banks. Vivek Kaul is an economist and the author of the Easy Money trilogy.

    "title": "Covid-19 and the Indian stock market movement",
    "body": "From United States to Japan , over 180 geographies have reported a confirmed case of coronavirus and almost everyone on this planet is adversely affected by this virus. An event of this scale would bring along many catastrophic consequences- social and economic. Many pundits have already declared COVID-19 as the “Black Swan” of 2020 with global economies starring at one of their worst recessions ever. There is something strange happening in the stock markets across the globe, especially India. To say the least, it seems like the markets are either not paying adequate seriousness to the pandemic or anticipating the discovery of a vaccine more optimistically when compared to the rest of the world. The bounce back to pre-COVID levels has left many investors in ambiguity. This piece is not about predicting what will happen to the markets going forward rather it talks about what could be a possible explanation to the path markets followed since the announcement of lockdown in India. Before we get into the numbers, almost all of us would agree that the Indian economy has never experienced such a massive shock- to both demand and supply in its recent past. The world of 2020 is in uncharted waters. While enough has been written about the increase volatility in the markets, below is some analysis on the daily movement of BSE Sensex for past 10 years. The analysis is based on the number of days the index gained or lost 1 per cent or more. This clearly shows how 2020 stands as an outlier when compared to 2011-2019, with approximately six months to go from here. 2020 stands tall among all these years with roughly having a 1 per cent or more gain/loss every second trading day. Take a look at this analysis from historical data. The above line represents the ratio of days the index gained 1 per cent or more to days when it lost 1 per cent or more. At 1.32, it is almost equal to the highest value which was 1.33 back in 2017. The line below depicts the index return for that year. There is a sharp divergence in 2020 as shown by the data. With a gain to loss ratio of 1.33, 2017 closed with a gain of 28 per cent but 2020, with a ratio of 1.32 has a return of -9 per cent so far till July 22nd, 2020. This means, the change in index in 2020 is skewed towards bigger negative values. The next graph makes this case stronger. Remember we have over five months to close this year. The frequency of the daily market moves is also exceptional. Of the 13 times when Sensex lost 2.5 per cent or more in 2020, seven came in the month of March. While it is relevant to draw comparison to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 with COVID-19 for medical reasons, no such event exists to draw parallel of COVID-19 and its impact on Indian financial markets. Though the mortality rate of COVID-19 is less when compared with Spanish flu, the implications for economy are far more severe. Back in those times, supply chains were not interlinked as they are today. One of the possible explanations of the markets reacting so sharply to COVID-19 in March is the supply chain integration across the globe. Recent developments have led to heavy reliance on geographically expansive supply chains and the ubiquity of just-in-time inventory systems. Both are highly vulnerable to sudden supply disruptions. While disruptions to international supply chains surely have contributed to a contraction in economic activity, but that might not be complete answer. If this was the case, the markets should have reacted when China went into a lockdown or when pandemic was at its peak in Europe. Another possible explanation could be the role and contribution of services in our GDP. Long distance travel has become common supporting tourism and hospitality sectors and facilitating commercial activity in education, entertainment , and other sectors. While we use technology in every sphere of life, the structure of economy has also evolved where interactions take place in proximity. An abrupt and compulsory lock down imposed on 1.3 bn Indians brought about uncertainty of future. Once people adjusted with the new normal of staying indoors, the odds of Sensex falling by 2.5% or more became less. I recognize that these conclusions have a broad bush character and there is much room for further investigations into the relative importance of voluntary social distancing efforts and government restrictions, as well as studies that seek to quantify the role of restrictions. There is also much room for research into the stock market reactions to fiscal and monetary policy actions during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "body": "Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in Dalal Street (Express photo by Nirmal Harindran) Share/Stock Highlights: The frontline equity indices on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended around 1 per cent lower on Monday tracking weakness in the global market. The S&P BSE Sensex crashed 524.96 points (0.89 per cent) to settle at 58,490.93, while the Nifty 50 ended at 17,396.90, down 188.25 points (1.07 per cent).

(with inputs from agencies) Live Blog Stocks, BSE Sensex, NSE Nifty, Crude oil prices, gold, silver prices, commodity market and money markets LIVE updates: 16:12 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 MARKET QUOTE | Milind Muchhala, Executive Director, Julius Baer on Monday's market performance \"The Indian markets finally seem to be taking a small pause, largely driven by nervousness in the global markets. Two key factors playing on the minds of global investors include the upcoming Fed meeting and the uncertainty building up in the Chinese real estate market due to stress on one of the major property players in the country. While the markets are keenly awaiting clarity on Fed’s taper plans in terms of timelines and quantum, we believe it may give an advance notice on tapering in this week’s meeting, followed by a formal announcement at the following meeting in November. The pace of tapering is expected to be gradual, and the Fed is expected to continue to remain accommodative in its monetary policy stance, which should be supportive for equities. Regarding the Chinese property major, it may be a bit too early to conclude on any possible contagion effects on global markets. Regarding the Indian markets, a few underperforming stocks/sections of the market, including the PSU pack, have started catching up to some extent, providing support to the headline indices. The breadth of the market, however, seems to be worsening a bit, which is a sign of caution. A small correction would be welcome at this juncture, and help the markets to become healthier, although the bulls are still not willing to give up reins. On the positive side, there is no fear factor currently, and investors seem to be on the lookout for corrections to add positions. With an improving pace and scale of vaccination, the economic environment is also expected to remain supported.\" 16:04 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 MARKET QUOTE | Vinod Nair, Head Of Research, Geojit Financial Services on Monday's market performance \"Following high volatility and weak global sentiments, the domestic market ended in a bear grip with Metal and PSU Banks leading the downward rally. Global markets traded negatively as investors were cautious ahead of multiple central bank policy meetings scheduled this week. However, due to weak US job data and inflation increasing at a slower pace, Fed is not expected to hint on taper plans in the upcoming meeting.\" 15:44 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 Equity markets at close The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 58,490.93, down 524.96 points or 0.89 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 17,396.90, down 188.25 points or 1.07 per cent. 15:17 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 Gold starts week on back foot as Fed meet looms, dollar gains Gold prices were pressured on Monday, hurt by a stronger dollar and concerns the US Federal Reserve might hint at when it intends to begin tapering its asset purchases in its upcoming meeting. Spot gold was little changed at $1,755.84 per ounce by 0847 GMT, having earlier touched its lowest level since Aug. 12 at $1,741.86. US gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,755.00. The Federal Reserve's keenly awaited policy meeting begins on Tuesday. (Reuters) 15:15 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 Copper futures fall on weak demand Copper futures on Monday slipped 1.71 per cent to Rs 708.85 per kg, as participants cut their positions amid muted demand in the domestic market. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for the September delivery eased by Rs 12.30, or 1.71 per cent, to Rs 708.85 per kg in a business turnover of 3,603 lots. Analysts said trimming of positions by speculators due to muted demand in the spot market mainly led to the fall in copper prices here.

Bajaj Finance was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying over 4 per cent, followed by SBI, Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and M&M. On the other hand, NTPC, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, Tata Steel and L&T were among the laggards. Benchmark indices have again pared all gains and are currently trading in negative territory. At around 2:10 pm, BSE Sensex was down by 26 points while Nifty fell below 11,450 points. Meanwhile, broader markets have yet again outperformed benchmark indices. The rupee on Tuesday closed flat at 74.32 per US dollar. Yash Gupta,Equity Research Associate, Angel Broking:Lupin Ltd got approval from the U.S. FDA for Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol, 90 mcg (base)/actuation, a generic version of ProAir® HFA. Lupin’s generic Albuterol Sulphate MDI will be manufactured at its Indore facility in India. ProAir® HFA are indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of asthmatic symptoms. Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol market had U.S. sales of approximately US$2.9 billion, of which the ProAir® HFA market accounted for US$1.3 billion (IQVIA MAT June 2020).This is one of the very significant approval for Lupin, which has been in the pipeline for some time and will be taken positively by the markets. Sensex and Nitty are off day's high and are currently trading flat. At 12:00 pm, Sensex was trading higher by 90.88 points at 38,889.96 while Nifty fell below the 11,500-mark. Jaikishan Parmar, Sr. Equity Research Analyst, Angel Broking:LIC reported Mixed set of numbers for Q1FY21, AUM increase 6% YoY and steady QoQ, PAT jumped by 34% to Rs.817.48cr. On moratorium front, Individual Home Loans under moratorium accounted for 16% an Approximately 25% of the Company’s total loans under management are in moratorium as of June 30, 2020. NII increase 3% YoY ted below AUM growth primarily owing to compression in NIM. Opex increase by 36%, however, lower provision cost has helped LIC housing to report PAT jump of 34% YoY. Considering the current situation provision taken in Q4FY20 and Q1FY20 is much lower than expected. Currently LIC housing trades at 0.75x of TTM Networth which is lower compare to the historical average. Considering lower valuation and not much negative in result stock could see positive movement for midterm. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, AngelBroking:Markets across the globe were quite cheerful yesterday morning and hence, we too started off higher above the11400mark. As the day progressed, the positive momentum reinforced after a brief pause; courtesy to smart surge in banking conglomerates. Eventually, the benchmark continued it’s march towards11500, marking highest level since March fiasco. Since last a week or so, we are sounding a bit cautious on the market. But it seems that market is in no mood to give any sort of correction. Actually, on the domestic front, there is no negative news flow which is considered as positive and most importantly, major global markets are clearly unstoppable, which is driving our markets higher. Although we have actively participated in the recent midcap rally, we still continue to be a watchful and would advise taking some money off the table. Because when markets are giving such gravity defying moves, nobody knows when and what’s going to trigger a correction. And whenever it happens, it just comes as a surprise. With a broader view, we remain extremely sanguine but do not want to become complacent here and hence would advise against aggressive longs in the market. As far as levels are concerned,11450-11500is an extended zone for us but with the flow, if it extends further, then we continue to advise booking profits in case if Nifty heads towards11550-11625.

Several analysts expect markets to open on a positive note on Tuesday after US stocks surged to touch record highs amid hopes of faster vaccine availability to treat coronavirus. European stocks also closed higher and Asian markets have begun the day on a strong note. All of the indicators hint at a strong opening for India markets. Top United States and Chinese officials have showed optimism on resolving issues over the Phase 1 trade deal reached in January and both sides are committed to the success of the agreement, according to the US Trade Representative's Office. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Tresury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke to Chinese Vice Premier Liu He over telephone to discuss the trade deal. This is another reason which boosted global markets. Asian stock markets opened significantly higher on Tuesday following a record Wall Street rally driven by vaccine hopes. The US dollar also found support ahead of the key central bank speech. Strong global cues indicate a solid gap-up opening for domestic markets in India. Domestic benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty, are expected to open higher on Tuesday after a strong rally in global stocks. SGX Nifty trends also indicate that markets in India will open higher for the second consecutive day. Global markets also got a boost after top US and Chinese officials showed optimism on the Phase 1 trade deal between the two countries. But analysts still warn investors and traders to proceed with caution as they expect markets to correct in the near-term.",

The global positive sentiment was driven by additional stimulus measures from ECB. Investors are banking on a global economic recovery, fuelled by central bank policy measures to support the respective economies. Investors need to be a bit cautious since valuations are running high and the expected recovery is not yet visible in the numbers,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said in a statement after the market hours. The rupee surrendered all intra-day gains to provisionally close on a flat note at 75.58 against the US dollar on Friday as investors looked for cues to move forward and take positions. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened strong at 75.38, but later pared gains and finally settled at 75.58 against the US dollar, down 1 paisa over its last close of 75.57. – with rupee inputs from PTI Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed.

    "body": "Gone are the times when school students were taught stories with the moral of “slow and steady wins the race”. However, in the age of 4 th Industrial Revolution, this moral has adapted itself and now rewards creativity and speed to “win a race.” This is especially true about the global financial sector- more so for the stock indices around the world. One of the most important indicators of any economy is the flagship stock market index of that country, for instance, Sensex in India and NASDAQ for the Unites States. Each day we come across these indices gaining or losing points and financial experts coming up with their targets for such indices. While they serve as a fair proxy to understand the state of an economy, which companies constitute these indexes and how much share does each company’s revenue have in these stock market indices, is also an interesting aspect to be understood. The BSE Sensex or the S&P BSE Sensex is a list of 30 companies that form a part of the BSE Index (Sensex). These companies are taken from diverse sectors and that too with a high market capitalisation. The base value of the S&P BSE Sensex is taken as 100 on 1 April 1979 and its base year as 1978-79, which is why we have taken companies that were there in 1978. The first iteration of the Sensex was dominated by the Tata Group. Over the years, there has been a lot of churn in the Sensex. In its early days, Sensex was dominated by manufacturing companies, there were as many as six Tata companies in the index — ACC, Tata Power, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Voltas and Indian Hotels. The extended Birla group had another five — Century Textiles, Grasim, Indian Rayon, Hindalco and Hindustan Motors. The Sensex now is less dominated by a few groups although, there are still three Tata companies in the list (TCS, Tata Steel and Titan). There was hardly any representation of banks in the Sensex until the early 1990s but today about 45% of the index is composed by financial sector companies . The latest addition to this list is Shree cements replacing Yes bank. The changing composition of the Sensex tells us two big stories — of the rise of a new generation of Indian firms as well as a broad shift from manufacturing towards services. A similar analysis of United States’ top firms reveals a shift from manufacturing to technology companies. A 100 years ago, US Steel was the world’s largest company by market capital, a title held by Apple Inc. today while other giants like Microsoft and Alphabet not very far either. The top-most five of the Top 10 companies in the Unites States by market capitalization today are technology companies, validating innovation as the “new moral”. An integral component of these firms’ success is their focus to emerging ventures called “startups” through their dedicated accelerator programs. While it is hard to imagine what this list would look like in the year, say, 2070, certainly it would not only be starkly different from what it is today but also would reflect the nature and relevance of finance in the coming years. Due to the emergence of disruptive business models, data has come to be a huge asset today- something that would have seemed impossible a few decades ago. The key to sustain in the business world today is to be creative and fast- a new moral to win the race . Update: On December 3, 2021, Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Infinity Forum on fintech, which among other things will discuss and come up with actionable insights into how technology can be leveraged by the fintech industry for inclusive growth.",

The rally in the domestic market was also led by Banking and Finance stocks on improved business outlook post Q2 results, end to moratorium and bounce back of economic activities.

We expect more stimulus measures are required to boost the economy and announcements regarding the same from the government is expected in the near future that can further accelerate our domestic market,”Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Servicessaid in a post-market statement. World stocks hit a record high on Monday and the dollar stayed weak as expectations of better global trade ties and more monetary stimulus under US President-electJoe Bidensupported risk appetite. Markets started to trade on the prospect of a Biden presidency and a Republican-controlled US Senate last week, but the Democratic candidate’s projected victory on Saturday gave more fuel to the move. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.5 per cent to a record high in early European hours. On Friday, it posted its biggest one-week gain in nearly seven months. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 jumped more than 1.4 per cent on Monday. Nasdaq futures rallied more than 2 per cent to just under a record high, signalling a positive start for US markets.

    "body": "The Bank Nifty index witnessed volatility throughout the day and ended negatively. After a gap-down opening, the index managed to hold the support of 38,800-38,500 on the downside, indicating the bias remains on the positive side. The immediate hurdle on the upside is placed at 39,500 and once taken out will see a sharp move on the upside towards 41,000 levels. Nifty remained sideways during the day before ending 1% lower. After starting to gap down on the back of a weak global cue, the Nifty failed to recover fully and traded within a range for the day. The momentum indicator is in a bearish crossover indicating a bearishness. On the lower end, 17400 may continue to act as crucial support, below which the index may become weak again. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 17700. Domestic indices moved in line with peers while prospects of higher rate hikes, elevated inflation and a slowing economy put pressure on stock markets around the world. Although India’s Q1 GDP was reported below the RBI’s estimate of 16.2%, the strong growth seen in manufacturing activity during Q2 so far indicates a strong recovery in the domestic market. Additionally, ongoing support from FIIs will obscure the weakness, helping domestic indices to stay resilient. Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "body": "Indian share indices ended 1.2% higher on Wednesday as soft crude oil prices supported sentiment. FMCG, banks & financials and auto stocks led the rally. Stocks dipped in Asia today as fears of an economic downturn lingered over financial markets, leaving the dollar hovering at the highest level in more than two years. Benchmark Indian indices clocked robust gains on Wednesday as inflation worries eased amid weakness in crude prices. Sensex closed 616.62 points or 1.16% higher at 53,750.97, and the Nifty rose 178.90 points to 15,989.80. Auto, FMCG, IT and banks & financials led the rally in the market today. Broad market indices were positive as the BSE midcap index rose 1.7%, and BSE Smallcap index gained around 1%. Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, and HUL were among the top gainers on the indices. Power Grid Corp, NTPC were among the major losers. Meanwhile, the Indian rupee recovered marginally to close at 79.31 against the US dollar. India's latest measures aimed at boosting domestic oil supplies could reduce its diesel and gasoline exports in the second half of the year, keeping global supplies tight and underpinning prices, traders and analysts said. The world is grappling with tight gasoline and diesel supplies as Western sanctions have reduced exports from Russia while demand has surged in a post-pandemic recovery. (Reuters) Bajaj Finance reported a good set of numbers for Q1FY23, Company reported the highest ever quarterly increase in its customer franchise of 2.7 MM. Bajaj Finance has reported its quarterly business update, the company's customer franchise reached 60.3 Mm as compared to 50.5 Mm last year, this is the highest quarterly increase in customer franchise by Bajaj finance of 2.7 Mm in Q1FY23. Along with the customer franchise the company has also reported good numbers for the new loan book which is at 7.4 Mm for Q1FY2023 as compared to 4.6 in Q1FY22. Overall the Q1FY23 quarterly update seems to be very strong for Bajaj Finance and the company is back on its pre-covid growth momentum. We expect bajaj finance to continue this growth momentum for the next couple of quarters. We have a neutral outlook on Bajaj Finance looking at the current valuations and comparing them with peers group. Goldman Sachs believes that Kotak Mahindra Bank stock may go up to₹2,135 per share levels in next 12 months and may hit $100 billion market cap by FY27. Goldman Sachs report says, \"We believe Kotak Mahindra Bank is positioned for an earnings upgrade cycle; we raise our estimates by 7%/13% for FY23E-FY25E on higher margins and lower loan-loss provisions, driving our 12-m TP to Rs2,135 (from Rs1,984, based on a blend of relative P/E and SOTP). We expect core operating profits to grow at a 22% CAGR (vs. a <15% CAGR in FY19-22) and net profits to grow at an 18% CAGR in FY22-25E (21% adj. for provision reversal in FY2022), and our FY23E-25E estimates are c.8% higher on average than VA consensus.\" A rise in public investment in production linked incentive scheme (PLI) has resulted in a growth in hiring intent for July-September as 61 per cent of companies surveyed said they are keen to hire more, according to a report by TeamLease Employment Outlook Report. The government has notified certain procedural changes in the GST rules, including those related to threshold, for filing annual returns for the 2021-22 fiscal, a move that will help ease the compliance burden on small players. The changes were vetted by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council at its meeting last week. With the amendments notified by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), businesses have also been allowed to make tax payments on the GSTN portal by using IMPS and UPI payment modes. (PTI) European shares climbed on Wednesday, as Norwegian oil and gas workers called off their strike and assuaged fears of a heightened energy supply crunch, while Just Eat Takeaway.com rose after Amazon agreed to buy a stake in unit Grubhub. The continent-wide STOXX 600 was up 1.3%. Germany's DAX gained 1.4% after losing almost 3% in the previous session. . Equities fell in Asia on Wednesday and the euro was stuck at a 20-year low as recession fears continued to flow through trading floors. Adding to the uncertainty was a fresh flare-up of coronavirus cases in parts of China that has seen some cities locked down. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 closed 1.2% lower, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.1%. Shanghai's Composite ended 1.4% lower. · Topline growth of 36% y/y (ex-financial & OMCs) is largely driven by E&P companies like Reliance and ONGC, while sectors like Automobiles and IT are also likely to see impetus, estimated to witness a low double-digit growth. Performance in 12 out of 15 sectors under our coverage (ex-financial & OMCs) is likely to see flattish growth in the quarter, indicating that only three sectors are doing most of the heavy lifting. · After seeing three consecutive quarters of contraction operating margins are likely to remain flat (up 15bps y/y) on account of strong margin expansion in Oil & Gas space (excluding OMCs). Auto sector is also likely to witness an expansion after three consecutive quarters of contraction. On the negative side, Cement, Pharma & IT are likely to witness margin collapse by 9.4, 3.4, and 2.3 ppts y/y basis respectively · PAT growth of 74% is predominantly driven by 147% PAT growth y/y for Oil & Gas (ex[1]OMC) space, (accounting for 45% of our earnings ex-Finance and OMC). While, Auto and Telecom, which reported losses in Q1 FY22 are also likely to witness significant positive traction For Financials: PAT to grow at 48% y/y, spearheaded by NBFC · NII for Banks is expected to register a healthy 16% y/y growth, boosted by a decent uptake in credit demand. Even though PPoP is likely to register a de-growth of 1.4% y/y, the lowest number on recent records as an unfavourable rise in G-Sec yield translates into a weak treasury income. Lower provisioning and higher NII will improve PAT by 29% y/y. · NBFC & SFB are likely to witness one of the strongest growth post-COVID. Both the topline and bottom-line are expected to grow by 25% and 145% y/y respectively Credit rating agency Icra on Wednesday said that malls can expect rental income to increase by 30% year-on-year in FY23 driven by improved recovery in business. Malls have reported an uptick in footfalls as well as demand; many retailers have also gone back to pre-covid rentals asmalls report recovery. Near normal economic activity, healthy retail sales (Q1FY23 averaging at ~92% of pre-Covid levels), robust demand in PV segment amid new launches in the SUV domain, cut in excise duty on fuels (| 8/litre on petrol, | 6/litre on diesel) in May 2022 and plummeting key raw material prices (mainly metals) towards the fag end of the quarter post their peak in April-May 2022 were the key highlights for Q1FY23E. Total industry volumes in Q1FY23 are expected to jump up ~10% QoQ led by the robust performance by the industry leader in the 2-W space with rest of the categories (PV, 3-W, CV) witnessing de-growth QoQ. Building in conservative estimates & quarterly lag of RM costs impact, we build in ~50 bps gross margin decline for our coverage companies in Q1FY23E. We expect our coverage universe (ex-Tata Motors) to report 1.5% QoQ topline growth & ~10 bps QoQ margin improvement to 12.2% with PAT expected to decline 9.7% QoQ primarily tracking exceptional gains in Q4FY22 (Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto). However, on a YoY basis, operational performance is likely to be robust at high double digit growth due to Covid impacted lower sales in the base year. The second half of 2022 will be another subdued period for equity capital markets, especially forinitial public offerings(IPOs) with a volatile stock market being one of many macroeconomic headwinds, experts said. Overall fundraising in the equity capital markets dropped to₹1.01 trillion in the first half of calendar year 2022, compared to a fundraising of₹1.26 trillion the same period last year, according to data from primary markets tracker Prime Database. Marico Ltd’s business update for the quarter-ended June (Q1FY23) indicated downtrading across products in essential categories on account of increased inflationary pressures. Saffola Oils volume fell by double digits year-on-year (y-o-y) as consumers shifted their preference from premium to mass segment in edible oils. Plus, it didn’t help matters that Q1FY22 had a high base owing to the increased in-house consumption. (Full report) Fast moving consumer goods maker Dabur India Ltd., expects its domestic business to post “high single digit” revenue growth in the June quarter, the company said in a quarterly update ahead of announcing earnings for the first quarter. A whole bunch of stocks will be in focus this week as they undergo their corporate actions and declare dividend, bonus shares, etc. One of the leading Indian pharma stocks engaged in research, development, manufacturing and marketing of generic pharmaceutical formulations, Torrent Pharma is set to declare bonus shares later this week. (Read here) Stable Demand Outlook and Digitalization to Support Revenue Growth We expect the IT companies under our coverage universe to report strong deal momentum (strong book-to-bill ratio and solid deal pipeline) across most verticals in 1HFY23 due to a strong demand seen for transformation and digitalization, while demand would moderate 2HFY23 onwards. We expect 2.4-3.7% and 2.5-3.7% sequential growth in CC revenue for 1QFY23 for the large cap and mid-cap companies, respectively. Further, revenue growth is likely to be broad-based across verticals. We expect the deal bookings to remain strong, given the ongoing digital transformation trend. Lower Utilization & Supply Side Issues to Impact Margins, but Attrition to Peak Out now We expect the companies under our IT sector coverage universe to report 47bps QoQ decline in EBIT margin due to: (1) accelerated hiring (both freshers and laterals) amid the high attrition; (2) marginal step-up in investment in sales and capabilities, and (3) lower utilization due to hiring freshers (4) higher S&GA cost, due to visa cost and increasing travel expenses. We highlight the margin pressure in 1QFY23 owing to higher employee incentives amid the rising attrition and cross-currency headwind. We expect companies with higher EU exposure to face stronger cross-currency headwind due to likely weakening of GBP and EUR against USD. Though attrition would remain elevated, we believe that it has already peaked out now. We expect cost pressure to continue over the next 2 quarters, while margin would recover with moderation in attrition in 2HFY23 and would stabilise. Additionally, we believe the large cap IT names are in a better position to address supply side concerns along with better pricing power compared to their mid-cap peers. Going ahead, we believe margin expansion would depend on: (1) improved pricing; (2) operating leverage (double-digit revenue growth); and (3) currency movement. IT Names to Maintain FY23 Revenue Growth Guidance We expect the IT companies to maintain revenue guidance for FY23 on the back of a deal backlog and healthy deal environment. We also believe a broad-based consensus exists among the large cap and mid-cap IT companies regarding better technology demand. We expect Infosys to maintain FY23 revenue growth guidance to 12-14% and EBIT margin in the range of 22-24%. We expect Indian IT names to record low-teen double-digit revenue growth in FY23 with minor moderation in margins in 1HFY23E due to cost pressure and currency headwinds, while margins would recover by ~50bps in 2HFY23E. We expect a decline in the utilization rate due to fresher hirings and a rise in discretionary cost. The IT sector (coverage universe) is set to post another quarter of healthy growth with decent CC growth despite cross currency headwinds and cost pressure, based on (1) increasing digital transformation/shift to cloud, 2) healthy deal pipeline, and 3) investment in the hyperscalers/SaaS ecosystem. We expect the IT companies to invest the margin gains that they witnessed over the last 2 years for capability addition and talent retention, which will aid their market share gain over the medium term. We also expect accelerated disclosures on the progress of cloud business. Majority of global enterprises are still at an early stage of digital adoption, which is a huge opportunity for the Indian IT companies for long term. Though FY23E revenue growth outlook for the sector remains strong, FY24E revenue growth would see moderation amid uncertainties on global business environment and worsening macros. We believe high salary inflation in developed markets, increasing travel expenses and higher visa costs would impact margins, despite some relief from better pricing. Post recent price correction, valuations are now below the 5-yr avg and further valuation contraction is unlikely. With double digit revenue growth and likely margin recovery 2HFY23 onwards, we remain positive on the sector despite near-term challenges. The pain for Indian stock market continues, with key benchmark index Nifty falling nearly 5% in June, following a 3% decline in May. The market closed in the red for the third consecutive month in June, marking the steepest month-on-month decline since March 2020, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Compared to other Asian markets, the Indian stock market has seen relatively less correction. For instance, key benchmark indices in Korea, Taiwan and Brazil have fallen over 10% each in June compared to May, in local currency terms. In fact, even the MSCI Emerging Markets index slumped 7% m-o-m in June. India recorded 16,159 fresh coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, pushing active cases in the country to 1,15,212, as per data released by the Union health ministry. With this, total covid cases reported in the country so far stand at 4,35,47,809. About 28 people succumbed to the disease in the last 24 hours, pushing the death toll to 525,270. Customer Franchise – Customer franchise stood at 60.3Mn( +19.4% YoY/ +4.7% QoQ). New customer acquisition improved and stood at 2.7mn(22.7% QoQ). Both these parameters have shown improvement over Q4’22 when there was a +3.9%QoQ rise in customer franchise and a 14% decrease QoQ in new customer acquisition AUM- Core AUM showed strong growth and came in at INR 20,40,000 Mn ( +30.7% YoY/+6.19% QoQ) New loans booked at 7.4Mn vs 4.6Mn in Q1’22 and 6.3Mn in Q4’22 Deposits came in at INR 3,41,000 Mn( +22% YoY/ +10.7% QoQ) . Deposit momentum has been strong last quarter had seen only a +2.6% QoQ rise. Outlook: AUM growth was strong but slightly below our expectation of 9% QoQ growth but customer acquisition has rebounded strongly after it had seen a de-growth in the last quarter which is a strong positive. Increasing customer acquisition through its omni channel is crucial and company has been successful in doing so We have a BUY rating valuing the company at 8.7x Sep’24E ABV with TP at₹8,953. On the technical front, 15650-15700 holds the demand zone for the index, and any correction could be seen as a buying opportunity. On the contrary, a decisive closure above the 16000 mark could only ascertain the bullish trend in the near period. Hence, looking at recent price action that construes an unclear market trend, participants are advised to avoid any undue risk and stay abreast with global developments. Also, as much action is seen outside the index, we advocate continuing with a stock-centric approach for better trading opportunities. The PLI scheme aims to provide nearly₹2.4 lakh crore worth of incentives over the next five years, with the lion's share going to electronics, auto components, and pharma. \"The Indian consumer was missing in action for almost 5 years due to multiple reasons like demonetization, GST, COVID, and lack of inflation. The growth in per capita GDP picked up in FY22 and per capita GDP was higher than in FY20 after a dip. The discretionary income of Indian consumers is likely to rise from FY23 to FY27,\" said brokerage firm Emkay Investment Managers.

With office occupancies and shopping mall footfalls rising steadily after two years of covid-related disruptions, these instruments have performed better than many other asset classes in recent quarters, experts said, with yields of 6-10%.

    "body": "Market Today:The frontline indices on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE) erased their intraday gains and ended around 0.5 per cent lower on Thursday on expiry of August-series futures and options (F&O) contracts. The S&PBSE Sensexcrashed 310.71 points (0.53 per cent) to end at 58,774.72 while theNifty 50declined 82.50 points (0.47 per cent) to settle at 17,522.45. Both the indices had opened over 0.4 per cent earlier in the day and traded higher for the bulk of the session rising around 0.7 per cent before giving up their gains and ending lower in the last hour of trade. On the Sensex pack,Bajaj Finance,Infosys,Tata Consultancy Services(TCS),IndusIndBank, Axis Bank, Power Grid Corporation of India, NTPC, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) were the top losers on Thursday whileMaruti SuzukiIndia, State Bank of India (SBI) and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories ended higher. Among the sectoral indices, the Nifty IT index fell 0.87 per cent, Nifty Metal index slipped 0.51 per cent and Nifty Pharma declined 0.40 per cent. On the other hand, the Nifty PSU Bank index rose 2.74 per cent and Nifty Realty climbed 1.47 per cent. In the broader market, the S&P BSE MidCap index ended at 25,019.90, up 50.56 points (0.20 per cent) while the S&P BSE SmallCap settled at 28,315.61, up 48.97 points (0.17 per cent). The volatility index or India VIX on NSE climbed 6.18 per cent to 19.57. Summing up the market, Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities noted, “Nifty fell on Aug 25, snapping a two day rise, on the monthly F&O expiry day, disregarding the mild gains in markets elsewhere. Nifty opened gap up and rose mildly in the morning. Post 1415 Hrs, a sell-off was seen in the Nifty leading it to close 0.47 per cent or 82.5 points lower at 17522.5. Among sectors, Realty and Consumer Durables were the main gainers while IT was the main loser. Broad market performed better than the Nifty as is evident from the positive close in Smallcap and Midcap indices and by the positive advance decline ratio.” Commenting on the Nifty he said, “Nifty has formed a bearish engulfing top on daily charts and seems to have formed a lower high on short term basis. Unless the high of 17,727 is breached, Nifty could witness declines/sell on rallies. A downward breach of 17,345 could lead to acceleration in the fall.” Share markets pushed higher and Europe’s bond markets and euro stole a breather from energy-price driven sell-offs on Thursday, as investors waited to hear the latest reaction of the world’s top central bankers to soaringinflation. Asia had tailgated Wall Street higher overnight and Europe’s bourses did the same as oil and gas stocks made another 1.5 per cent jump amid intensifying worries of a Russian gas supply crisis. The 0.7 per cent rise in European stocks left MSCI’s 47-country index of world shares up 0.4 per cent with US stock futures pointing to similar gains for the S&P 500 later. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.7 per cent, after US stocks ended the previous session with modest gains. Australian shares climbed 0.7 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index was up by 0.72 per cent. China’s CSI300 rose 0.8 per cent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged 3.6 per cent in a shortened trading session due to a typhoon. Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed. The brothers Provit and Sorbojit Thaosen were among the victims, along with four others from their village.

    "title": "Sensex hits all-time high: Will the dream run continue?",
    "body": "Benchmark index S&P BSE Sensexhit an all-time high during intraday trade on Wednesday, surpassing the previous peak it achieved in 2022. In December 2022, the Sensex achieved its previous all-time high of 63,583.07. The 30-share index rose over 260 points to hit a fresh all-time high of 63,588.31 in early trade but fell shortly after due to selling pressure. The NSE Nifty 50 is also eyeing a fresh record and was roughly 30 points away from achieving the milestone at around 1:40 pm. So, what's driving the bull run on Dalal Street? Both benchmark indices have been gaining over the past few months, driven by a host of macroeconomic factors such as lower inflation and stronger growth projections. Persistent foreign inflows have also been a key factor in boosting the domestic benchmark indices. It may be noted that foreign investors have put in over 73 lakh crore so far this financial year. Compared to this, foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the two previous financial years. V.L.A. Ambala (SEBI Registered Research Analyst), Stock Market Today (SMT), said, \"It is another record day in India's stock market. As we had said yesterday, the price was getting ready for a new all-time high, and today Sensex has made a new all-time high of 63,588.31.\" \"We are still in a bull run and the trend is very steep. Fundamentally strong and financially stable stocks are seeing an increase in their volumes,\" she added. Meanwhile, Gaurav Dua, senior vice president and head of capital market strategy at Sharekhan, told news agency Reuters that the Indian economy is in a multi-year upcycle, which is a major positive. \"While there are pockets of overvaluation, pockets of opportunity also exist in markets,\" said Dua. \"The indexes may be at or near record highs, but the valuations are not, thanks to healthy earnings growth over the past 20 months,\" he added. One of the key reasons behind the bull run can be attributed to a sharp acceleration in India's economic growth in the March quarter, in addition to a sharp drop in inflation. With this, the country remains on track to be the fastest-growing economy in the world. Analysts said that the fundamentals of the domestic stocks remain strong, but it is better to wait and watch as upcoming events could provide cues for the future. \"I must say just wait and watch for some time. Right now, I do not see any reason to sell the price except that we are near to an all-time high, so hold it until there is no signal of profit booking,\" Ambala said. \"To be more specific, 62,000 is a strong support level for this bullish movement and if the price sustains at the current range, we will be proudly witnessing Sensex trade in the 65,000 to 75,000 range in this financial year,\" she added. \"Keep in mind that as an economy, we are attracting global interest, and that is a positive side for us,\" she added.

    "title": "Sensex tumbles 600 points: 3 reasons behind stock market volatility",
    "body": "Benchmark indices in the Indian stock market saw a sharp decline on Friday, reversing the bullish momentum from the previous session. At 10:50 am, the S&P BSE Sensex dropped by 608.97 points, settling at 79,334.74, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 174.40 points, trading at 24,014.25. \"The much anticipated Santa Claus rally didn’t materialize this year, but the New Year rally did make a brief appearance, lasting just for a day. Yesterday, Nifty managed to close above the critical 200 DMA at 24,188, maintaining its strength despite challenges,\" said Trivesh, COO Tradejini. The downturn highlights the persistent volatility on Dalal Street, with investors uncertain about the short-term market trajectory. While auto and IT stocks had propelled a rally just a day ago, profit booking amid prevailing uncertainty appears to have weighed heavily on sentiment. Here are three key factors contributing to today’s decline: After rallying strongly in the previous session, IT and financial stocks faced significant profit booking in early trade on Friday. Market experts attributed the dip to investor caution ahead of the corporate earnings season, which typically brings heightened market fluctuations. The Nifty IT index plunged nearly 2%, making it the biggest loser among sectoral indices. Similarly, the Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices fell by almost 1% each, dragging down the broader market. This retreat followed a robust performance in the previous session, where the Nifty IT and Nifty Financial indices rose by 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Aditya Gaggar, Director at Progressive Shares, had forecasted a pullback in IT stocks and the benchmarks following the sharp rally, cautioning investors against over-optimism. \"Today’s decline can be attributed to profit booking in the IT and financial sectors, where selling pressure was evident after the index tested resistance near 24,196. While major banks continued to display resilience with steady inflows, broader market sentiment reflected caution. Additionally, global cues played a role, with the US markets’ five-day consecutive fall impacting sentiment, even as Asian markets showed resistance. While hopes for sustained momentum were high, the market quickly shifted focus, with traders opting for profit-booking amid cautious global cues,\" said Trivesh. Declines in heavyweight stocks exacerbated the fall in major indices. Shares of HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, and ICICI Bank all fell by over 1% during the session. Other notable losers included Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp, and Cipla. These large-cap stocks, which hold significant weight in the indices, were critical in dragging down the market, indicating a broader sell-off among blue-chip companies. Growing concerns over the upcoming Q3 corporate earnings season further dampened investor sentiment. Following a weak performance in the second quarter, analysts had highlighted that the Q3 results could set the tone for the market in the coming months. Although there is optimism that the Q3 earnings may show improvement, concerns persist that an earnings slowdown could extend for another couple of quarters. Analysts also pointed out that the trajectory of the stock market will likely hinge on announcements in the Union Budget 2025. A potential increase in government capital expenditure could drive new orders for companies, bolstering their earnings and improving stock performance over time. Today’s market decline underscores the heightened uncertainty and cautious sentiment among investors. As the corporate earnings season approaches and the Union Budget draws nearer, market participants will be closely watching for signs of stability and growth. For now, volatility continues to dominate the Indian stock market.

    "body": "Benchmark stock market indices fell sharply after opening higher on Monday, led by a decline in PSU banking sector stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex was down 1165.74 points to 78,057.37, while the NSE Nifty50 lost 366.85 points to 23,637.90 as of 12:02 PM. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that the market is likely to be influenced by the negative factors impacting FII flows and some positive domestic factors which can support the market. The market volatility saw a huge spike and reached 13.20 on Nifty50. The broader markets faced huge selling pressure, with both indices trading in red. Nifty Smallcap100 took a bigger hit, declining 2.50%, while Nifty Midcap100 fell 2.23%. \"The external macro construct continues to be unfavourable with the dollar index at 109 and the 10-year US bond yield at 4.62%. The FIIs are likely to continue selling till the yields decline and the dollar stabilises. Domestically, the December auto numbers indicate that the much talked about urban demand deceleration is exaggerated. Buying will resume in these resilient domestic segments, supporting the market on declines,\" said Vijayakumar. A major reason for today's market crash can be attributed to thediscovery of 2 HMPV cases in India, triggering a market selloff. Two babies were detected with HMPV in Bengaluru hospital with no international travel history on Monday. In a brutal sell-off today, all sectoral indices on the Nifty traded in red, with no sectors managing to stay afloat with Nifty PSU Bank seeing the biggest fall, declining by 3.63%. Nifty Metal bore the brunt of the selling, plunging 2.98%, while Nifty Realty tumbled 2.77%. Nifty Financial Services Ex-Bank dropped sharply by 2.31%, and Nifty Media fell 2.21%. The auto sector wasn't spared either, with Nifty Auto declining 2.05%. Banking stocks faced heavy pressure as Nifty Private Bank fell 1.89%, Nifty Bank dropped 1.88%. Financial services indices also took a hit with Nifty Financial Services 25/50 falling 1.78% and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.62%. The selling extended to other sectors as well, with Nifty Oil & Gas dropping 2.45%, Nifty Midsmall Financial Services falling 2.58%, and Nifty Midsmall IT & Telecom declining 1.97%. Nifty FMCG lost 1.53%, Nifty Pharma fell 1.33%, Nifty Consumer Durables decreased 1.43%, and Nifty Healthcare Index dropped 1.06%.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty continue winning streak: 3 reasons why stock market gained today",
    "body": "The stock markets have shown signs of recovery after falling almost 12% from it's September high as it continued its winning streak, extending gains for the third starlight session on Thursday. Sensex gained over 400 points in early trade while Nifty was up nearly 150 points. The S&P BSE Sensex was up 308.61 points to 77,032.69, while the NSE Nifty50 added 105.75 points to 23,318.95 as of 10:25 AM. Rise in the stock marketcould be attributed to several factors, of which the positive US inflation data was the biggest trigger for Sensex and Nifty. US stocks rose on Wednesday night after new numbers showed US core inflation grew less than what experts had thought it would. This good news spread to Asian stock markets on Thursday, pushing them higher too. The US dollar and interest rates on US government bonds have come down a bit in the last few days. Some market watchers think the recent rise in stocks tied to Donald Trump might have reached its peak. Adding to the positive market sentiment in markets, Israel and Hamas agreed to stop fighting in Gaza, which helped calm worries about the conflict. This made investors feel better about putting money into stocks. Many think this could slow down the recent trend of foreign investors taking their money out of markets. Closer to home, investors were waiting eagerly for three big Indian companies - Reliance Industries, Infosys, and Axis Bank - to share their latest earnings reports later in the day. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that macro indicators from the US suggest that as the swearing-in of Mr Trump nears, the Trump trade has peaked. \"The decline in US bond yields and the dollar index are indications of this. This downshift in the dollar index and bond yields has been assisted by the lower-than-expected CPI inflation in the US, again igniting hopes of more rate cuts by the Fed this year. Hope of an end to the conflict in Gaza is another major relief. This global backdrop is positive for the market,\" he added.He also said that a relief rally in India is certainly on the cards, but the sustainability of the rally will depend on the Indian macros, particularly the revival of GDP and earnings growth. \"Budget expectations can aid a rally in the market but it will soon give way to the trends in GDP and earnings growth. Investors should focus on largecaps which have been more stable than the mid and small caps. Broadly speaking, segments with growth visibility like Pharma and health care, IT and discretionary consumption will remain resilient,\" said Vijayakumar. Theshare price of HDFC Life Insurance Company surgedalmost 11% on January 16 after the insurer announced its October-December quarter results, which was much better than what Dalal Street had expected. HDFC Life shares were up 10.28% to Rs 655.35 at around 10:17 am. Earlier, the stock had reached a days high of Rs 657.80. The company posted a 14% rise in net profit in Q3 FY25 at Rs 415 crore, higher than Rs 365 crore in the same period last year, driving positive investor sentiment.",

    "title": "Sensex falls over 600 points: Why is stock market down today? 3 key reasons",
    "body": "Benchmark stock market indices tanked in early trade on Monday extending their downward momentum and continued to be under pressure, led by a decline in auto, banking and metal sector stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex was down by 657.97 points to 76,720.94, while the NSE Nifty50 fell 199.60 points to 23,231.90 as of 9:20 AM. Sensex and Nifty closed lower on Friday for the third straight session, extending their losses, and the same trend continued in today's trading session, marking the fourth consecutive session of falls. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that market will continue to be under pressure from the many strong headwinds. Rupee hits a record low -TheIndian rupee crashed 23 paise to a historic low of 86.27against the US dollar in early trade. This drop came after stronger-than-expected US jobs data dampened hopes for significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025. The rupee opened at 86.2050 against Friday’s close of 85.9650. A weak rupee increases import costs, particularly for crude oil, and adds to inflationary pressures in the economy. US jobs data and rate concerns -The US added 2.56 lakh jobs in December, far exceeding expectations of 1.65 lakh. This pushed the US unemployment rate down to 4.1%. While this highlights a strong US economy, it has led to reduced expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “The robust US jobs data means the Fed is unlikely to cut rates significantly this year. This good economic news for the US is turning out to be bad news for global markets, including India, which were hoping for rate cuts to boost liquidity.” Rising crude oil prices -Brent crude prices rose to $81 per barrel, creating concerns for India, a major importer of crude oil. Higher crude prices increase input costs for businesses and could lead to higher inflation, adding to the challenges for the Indian economy. IndusInd Bank emerged as the top gainer on Nifty50 in early trade, rising by 3.09%, while Shriram Finance moved up by 0.27%. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) gained 0.25%, followed by Britannia Industries with a 0.12% increase, and Axis Bank which edged up by 0.10%. On the losing side, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) led the declines with a drop of 2.38%, while Apollo Hospitals Enterprise fell 1.93%. SBI Life Insurance Company declined by 1.90%, followed by Mahindra & Mahindra which slipped 1.77%. Wipro rounded out the major losers with a decline of 1.61%. Analysts suggest that while the near-term outlook remains challenging, there could be opportunities for long-term investors. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “The market is approaching critical levels, with Nifty near its recent low of 23,263. A break below this level could see the index falling to 23,000 or even 22,260. However, any recovery above 23,540 could signal strength and give bulls a chance to regroup.” Dr Vijayakumar added that the strength of the US economy could support IT stocks, which have been relatively resilient. He also said that healthcare and pharma sectors may remain stable due to steady demand.",

    "title": "Sensex jumps 600 points. Why is stock market rising today?",
    "body": "Benchmark stock market indices gained on Monday, fuelled by gains in banking and financial services stocks, which countered concerns over US policy framework under US President-elect Donald Trump. While volatility on Dalal Street gained during the trading session, gains in major shares such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Wipro, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, SBI and Reliance Industries contributed to the market gains. The S&P BSE Sensex had jumped over 600 points in early trade. At 12:35 pm, the 30-share index was up 512.23 points to 77,131.56. The NSE Nifty50 was trading 130.35 points higher at 23,333.55. One of the major factors behind today’s gains on Dalal Street was a 10% jump in the share price of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares gained after the private lender reported strong results in the third quarter. Analysts have also shared bullish views on the lender’s stock after the Q3FY25 results. IT giant Wipro’s share price also jumped sharply after it reported better-than-expected results in the December quarter. Wipro’s stock jumped as much as 8% in early trade to hit a day’s high of Rs 305.35. Wipro’s consolidated profit jumped 24% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 3,354 crore and revenue from operations rose 0.5% to Rs 22,319 crore. The IT firm also declared a dividend of Rs 6 per share. Although Wipro’s results were in line with estimates, brokerages still want investors to remain a bit cautious due to challenges in critical verticals and geographies. Despite today’s gains, Dalal Street is likely to remain volatile as global stock markets will be in a wait and watch mode as Trump 2.0 unfolds today, said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “Many executive actions, particularly on immigration, are expected from the President starting from day one. Markets will wait and watch for the nature of the decisions and their likely impact,” Vijayakumat added. On the brighter side, he highlighted that the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) report on Global Economic Outlook projected India to register a solid growth of 6.5% for 2025 and 2026 for India. “This is positive.” He also noted that there is a flurry of Q3 results this week and the market will respond to the results depending on, apart from the numbers, the outlook and management commentary.

    "title": "Sensex crashes over 1,200 points: What's behind  ₹7 lakh crore market rout today? Here are 5 key reasons",
    "body": "Stock market crash:The Indian stock market witnessed a strong selloff in trade on Tuesday, January 21, as investors remained cautious after US President Donald Trump unveiled plans for trade tariffs on neighbouring countries shortly after taking office. Both benchmark indices, the Sensex and the Nifty 50, declined over 1 per cent each. The 30-pack Sensex declined 1,235 points, or 1.60 per cent, to close at 75,838.36, while its NSE counterpart, Nifty 50, lost 320 points, or 1.37 per cent, to end at 23,024.65. Shares of Zomato, NTPC, Adani Ports, ICICI Bank, SBI and Reliance Industries ended as the top losers in the Sensex index. Only two stocks- UltraTech Cement and HCL Tech- closed with gains in the index, while shares of Hindustan Unilever ended flat. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices dropped 2 per cent each. A sharp selloff in the Indian stock market wiped out over₹7 lakh crore of investors' wealth, as the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms fell to approximately₹424.3 lakh crore from₹431.6 lakh crore in the previous session. Investors sold equities across sectors as all sectoral indices on the NSE ended with significant losses. Nifty Realty and Consumer Durables ended with a deep cut of over 4 per cent, while Nifty Bank, Auto and Financial Services closed almost 2 per cent lower each. Here are five key factors that weigh on stock market sentiment: On the very first day in office, Trump made several announcements, including tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Trump has threatened higher tariffs on several countries, including India. His immigration policies could also impact the Indian tech sector. \"Trump 2.0 has kicked off without much clarity on Trump’s likely economic decisions. In his inaugural address, he was clear on immigration but sounded vague about tariffs. The indication of a likely 25 per cent tariff on Canada and Mexico suggests that the tariff hike policy will be implemented gradually,\" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. According to Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities, investors now fear that Trump's inaugural speech to safeguard America's interest could hurt the economic prospects of many countries, including India, going ahead. Investors are now focused on this mega-policy event. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present theBudgeton Saturday, February 1. Expectations are high that the government will announce measures to boost consumption, strengthen the rural sector, and support manufacturing and infrastructure, all while maintaining fiscal prudence. However, any disappointment in key expectations could deliver another blow to the already weak market sentiment. A relentless selloff by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) amid the strengthening US dollar and rising bond yields is a key factor behind the Indian stock market's downtrend in recent months. Except for January 2, FPIs have been selling Indian equities every day in January, offloading nearly₹51,000 crore as of January 20. After weak Q1 and Q2 earnings, the December quarter earnings so far have also been unimpressive, exhibiting mixed trends across sectors. Experts say disappointment on the earnings front is keeping market sentiment subdued. \"While the Indian economy is doing fine fundamentally, corporate earnings have been weak for a few quarters as economic activity has slowed. Markets track earnings and flows,\"Priyanka Khandelwal, a fund manager at ICICI Prudential AMC, told Mint. The Indian economy is showing signs of weakness, which has contributed to the cautious sentiment in the market. \"We are not seeing broad-based demand growth in the country, which is delaying the intensity of the private capex cycle we should see in India. Government capex has also slowed down, and that’s hurting non-farm employment. Hence, despite the policy interventions to accelerate growth in our economy, we’re seeing softness,\" Khandelwal said.

The S&P BSE Sensex was trading 800.18 points lower at 76,281 at 11:12 am, while the NSE Nifty50 dipped 200 points to 23,144.75. All other broader market indices also declined sharply during the session, impacting smallcap and midcap stocks. Volatility also registered a sharp increase during the trading session. Donald Trump has returned to the White House for his second term as US President. Hesigned a bunch of executive orders, but it was his remark on tariffs that seemed to have rattled global stock markets, including Dalal Street. He announced plans to announce trade tariffs on neighbouring countries just hours after taking office. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said Trump’s tariff decisions remain a wildcard despite no immediate announcement. Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, added that Trump 2.0 has kicked off without much clarity on his likely economic decisions. \"In his inaugural address, he was clear on immigration but sounded vague on tariffs. The indication of a likely 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico suggests that the tariff hike policy will be implemented gradually,\" Vijayakumar said. \"It is likely that further delays in tariff hikes will weaken the dollar and bring down the bond yields. If this happens, it will be good for emerging markets like India. But if the FII flows to India are to turn positive consistently, we will have to see a pickup in India’s GDP growth and corporate earnings,\" he explained. \"That’s the crucial macro data to watch,\" he added.",

    "title": "Sensex jumps 800 points: 5 reasons why stock market is rising ahead of Budget",
    "body": "The stock market surged in the afternoon session on Friday, a day before Budget 2025, with the Sensex and Nifty gaining almost 1%. While the S&P BSE Sensex surged nearly 800 points to reach a day's high of 77,537.12, Nifty gained almost 300 points, both extending their gains for the 4th consecutive day. The S&P BSE Sensex was up 766.21 points to 77,526.02, while the NSE Nifty50 climbed 275.10 points to 23,524.60 as of 1:30 pm. Below are the reasons behind the market rally on Dalal Street ahead of the Union Budget 2025 presentation: Investors are hopeful that the government will announce policies to support economic growth. Expectations of tax relief, higher spending on infrastructure, and incentives for key industries have boosted market sentiment. A strong push towards manufacturing and job creation could further improve the economic outlook. Shares of IT, auto, and consumer durable companies have been among the biggest gainers. Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, said, \"Investor optimism is driving market sentiment, fueled by expectations of policy measures that could support economic growth. Historically, Budget Day has been volatile, but data shows that Nifty has closed positively after the Budget in 12 out of the last 18 years since 2010. While initial reactions may be mixed, markets often recover if key measures align with expectations.\" Market experts believe that possible tax relief for individuals and businesses could boost spending and investments. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, \"Since we are heading into the Budget without a major pre-Budget rally, the chances of a post-Budget rally are higher if the government introduces growth-boosting measures like cuts in personal income tax. However, it is important to note that the Budget's impact on the market will be short-lived. In the long run, stock market trends will depend on GDP growth and corporate earnings.\" Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been selling stocks in recent weeks, but the pace of selling has slowed down. Kranti Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, said, \"Foreign portfolio investors continue to be sellers, but the volume of selling has reduced significantly. If the Budget offers favourable policies, we may see more buying from both domestic and foreign investors.\" As corporate earnings for the quarter are being announced, investors are looking for companies with strong profits. Stocks of companies that have reported good results are rising, while those with weaker numbers are facing pressure. Analysts suggest that investors should focus on long-term opportunities rather than short-term movements around the Budget. Market direction in the coming days will depend on the Budget announcements. If the government presents policies that meet investor expectations, the rally could continue. However, unexpected changes or concerns over fiscal spending could lead to volatility. Experts advise investors to remain cautious and wait for the Budget before making major investment decisions.

    "body": "Stock Market Today:Domestic equity markets witnessed continued selling pressure on Monday on concerns over slowingthird quarter earningsgrowth and outflows from foreign portfolio investors. The 30-shareBSE Sensexdeclined 824.29 points, or 1.08 per cent, to 75,366.17. The broaderNifty 50tanked 263.05 points, or 1.14 per cent, to close at 22,829.15. “Broad-based selling across sectors plummeted the Indian market amidst tepid earnings and weak sentiments across the globe. Weak sentiments were further exacerbated as the US trade confrontation continued, like with Colombia this time, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. Analysts expect volatility to remain in the market this week ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on January 28-29 andUnion Budget2025-26 announcement on February 1. Foreign investors remained on a selling spree due to moderation in economic growth and the rupee depreciation. On Monday, foreign investors net sold Rs 5,015.46 crore of equities, and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased Rs 6,642.15 crore of shares, BSE’s provisional data showed. So far in the current month (till January 27), foreign portfolio investors net sold Rs 67,022 crore of Indian equities, as per the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) data. On Monday, the rupee depreciated 9 paise to close at 86.31 against the US dollar. “A combination of factors like weak US and European market cues, monthly F&O (futures & options) expiry later this week, persistent FII fund outflows, and muted third quarter corporate earnings so far have continued to push investors in reducing their equity exposure,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. Mid and small caps remained in their downward trajectory over expensive valuations and slowdown in earnings. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices lost 2.68 per cent and 3.51 per cent, respectively. Strong selling was seen in sectors such as information technology, telecom, metals, oil & gas and realty which dragged the Sensex below the 76,000 mark, Tapse said. The NSE companies that fell the most includedHCL Technologies(4.59 per cent)Tech Mahindra(4.18 per cent),Wipro(3.78 per cent), Hindalco Industries (3.53 per cent) and Shriram Finance (3.22 per cent). Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed. The brothers Provit and Sorbojit Thaosen were among the victims, along with four others from their village. The incident highlights the lack of employment opportunities and low wages that force many from their villages to work as migrant workers.",

    "title": "Stock market crash: Investors lose Rs 10 lakh crore. What's ahead for D-Street?",
    "body": "Bears took control of the stock market as Dalal Street bled on Monday, extending its losses into 2025. Sensex and Nifty fel over 1%, resulting in a loss of nearly Rs 10 lakh crore for stock market investors. The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 677.78 points to 75,512.78, while the NSE Nifty50 was down 217.45 points to 22,874.75 as of 12:42 AM. Investors on Dalal Street faced losses as stock markets continued to decline, bringing the market capitalisation of all listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) down by Rs 9.48 lakh crore, settling at Rs 410.03 lakh crore. Experts attributed the sstock market crash to a mix of factors, including weak market sentiment, global uncertainty, and selling pressure from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Persistent FPI outflows and profit bookings have added to the volatility, with concerns about key upcoming events weighing on investor confidence. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, commented, \"This 6-day week is likely to be highly volatile with other major events like the Fed decision and the Budget in India. The market is looking forward to fiscal stimulus through income tax cuts in the Budget. If the expectations are met, there can be a relief rally in the market. But if a rally is to sustain, we need data indicating growth and earnings revival.\" The weak sentiment has been compounded by sustained FPI selling. FPIs have pulled out Rs 69,000 crore from Indian markets in January so far, further contributing to the downward pressure. Although domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have bought shares worth Rs 67,000 crore during the same period, their efforts have not been enough to counterbalance the losses. Global uncertainties have also played a significant role in dampening investor sentiment. Trivesh, COO of Tradejini, said, \"Markets today have declined due to a mix of global and domestic concerns. The market appears to be nervous about the impact of tightening on global liquidity, as the US Federal Reserve is set to announce its next monetary policy decision.\" Adding to these worries are trade tensions and geopolitical risks. \"The rise of China’s DeepSeek AI has raised alarms about the growing competition in the global technology race. Moreover, there is an additional burden of global uncertainty as trade tensions have risen due to tariffs on Colombia,\" Trivesh added. The prospect of new tariffs by the United States is another area of concern. President Trump has reportedly threatened a 25% tariff on Colombia for refusing to take back deported illegal immigrants. Similar tariffs on Canada and Mexico are expected to come into effect from February 1, raising questions about the broader implications of these policies on global trade and economic stability. The prices of crude oil have remained under pressure, reflecting concerns about slowing demand as global growth tapers off. This has added to the challenges for Indian markets, as the country is a major importer of crude oil. Meanwhile, quarterly corporate earnings have been another source of disappointment, failing to provide any relief to the markets. Persistent FII outflows, combined with global risk aversion, have triggered capital flight, adding to the pressure on domestic equities. Domestic investors are also closely watching the Union Budget, which will be presented soon. Market participants are hoping for fiscal stimulus measures, including income tax cuts, to support growth and boost investor sentiment. However, uncertainty around the budget has heightened market volatility, with many investors adopting a cautious stance. Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities, said, “Nifty is trading below the crucial 23,000 level. Anything below this creates panic and leads to furious selling. Today, we are witnessing visible pressure in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.

    "title": "Sensex tumbles 500 points: Why is the stock market falling today",
    "body": "Benchmark market indices tumbled sharply on Monday, dragged lower byheavy selling in information technology (IT) countersafter the Donald Trump-led US administration announced a steep hike in H-1B visa application fees. The S&P BSE Sensex was down 503.31 points at 82,122.92 by 2:55 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 slipped 143.80 points to 25,183.20. Volatility surged across broader market segments, with most indices in the red. The Nifty IT index slumped over 3%, leading the fall on Dalal Street. Tech giants including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech and Tech Mahindra bore the brunt of the selloff, as investors priced in the potential hit to margins from the US decision to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. While the shock announcement from President Trump clearly rattled sentiment, analysts say the selloff reflects more than just visa concerns. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, told India Today that the Indian IT sector has been battling a combination of pressures. “While the shock fromPresident Trump’s H-1B fee announcementclearly hit sentiment and triggered a panic in the Indian IT sector, the weakness actually runs deeper and is multi-faceted. Beyond visa costs, the sector has been grappling with a structural slowdown in project spending from international clients and slower deal closures,” Singhania said. He added that the majority of Indian IT revenue still comes from the US market, making it highly sensitive to both tariffs and regulatory shocks. “With tariffs already a major blow to export-related sectors including IT, clients have been cautious in spending on new projects. The H-1B has only added to the uncertainty related to margin pressure for ITs,” he noted. The sudden fall in IT shares has left investors questioning their strategy. According to Singhania, existing shareholders should remain calm and avoid knee-jerk selling. “For investors already holding IT stocks, the sensible approach is to remain calm and avoid hurried selling. The industry is under strain from factors such as regulatory uncertainty and reduced client spending, yet these pressures do not take away from its broader importance in global technology services,” he said. He added that patience with well-managed companies could prove rewarding in the long run, though recovery may take time. “Long-term portfolios can hold patiently, but if exposure is high, partial profit booking might be taken into consideration. The key is to remain watchful of sector commentary, deal wins, and demand outlook.” For those eyeing fresh investments in IT stocks, Singhania advised caution. “For new investors, adopting a wait-and-watch approach would be beneficial. The IT industry is going through a phase of change, with shifting client demand and policy uncertainties still unfolding,” he explained. However, he noted that long-term structural drivers remain intact. “Trends like cloud, digital, and AI adoption are not going away. The current weakness eventually could offer attractive entry points. Gradual accumulation and spreading investments would enable investors to participate in the sector’s eventual recovery while also limiting the risk of catching steep downside and losses.” The sharp fall in IT stocks highlighted the fragility of market sentiment at a time when global policy risks are converging with structural challenges in India’s largest export sector. While the H-1B visa fee shock served as a trigger, analysts warn that the pressure on margins and deal flow could keep the sector under stress in the near term. For investors, the turbulence is a reminder of the importance of patience, diversification, and close attention to global policy shifts that can ripple through Dalal Street in a single session.",

India’s stock market has become accustomed to foreign investors serving as a reliable engine of funds, with a net $59bn of money flowing in over the past six years. But so far this year that trend has reversed, with the market on course for its first year of net foreign outflows since 2011 — contributing to a hefty decline in the value of the rupee as the currency has plumbed to its weakest level versus the US dollar in recent weeks. Yet amid the foreign selling, India’s Nifty 50 stock index has climbed to a succession of record highs this year. Up 7 per cent in the year to date, the market remains near its all-time peak even after a softening in late August. These contrasting movements are the latest sign of the Indian stock market being increasingly driven by domestic investment, while foreign investors have a less powerful role to play, despite their broadly positive view on the country’s economic outlook. For centuries, Indian households have kept their savings overwhelmingly in property and gold. However, growing financial literacy, coupled with reduced fears of inflation, is now driving a surge of domestic money into the stock market. Indian equity mutual funds had net inflows of Rs780bn ($10.7bn) in the first eight months of this year, according to industry trade group AMFI, easily outweighing the net selling of Rs59bn by foreign equity investors. The domestic buying has driven the Indian market’s valuation to unusually high levels, noted Mahesh Nandurkar, Indian equity strategist at CLSA. On a price-to-earnings basis, the Nifty now enjoys a 60 per cent premium to the emerging markets average, he estimated. It is concerned about overheated valuations, rather than India’s economic outlook, that have caused foreign investors to pare their exposure to Indian stocks, said Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers. “The role that foreign investors used to play has been taken over by domestic investors,” he said. “And that has pushed valuations to a level where foreign investors don’t feel comfortable.” But foreign selling in India’s debt market has been even larger, with net outflows of Rs443bn in the first eight months of the year amid tightening US monetary policy. That pushed the 10-year government bond yield this week to 8.14 per cent, its highest level since 2014, while sending the rupee to a record low of Rs72.97 to the dollar. The rupee’s slide has prompted foreign equity investors such as Robert Secker, at M&G Investments, to focus more on sectors such as IT services, which benefit because their revenues are mostly earned abroad and their costs are largely domestic. Shares in the largest of these companies, Tata Consultancy Services, have risen 66 per cent alone in the past year, against 11 per cent for the Nifty as a whole. And while the rupee’s slide has depressed foreign investors’ Indian returns in dollar terms, Mr Secker added, the country’s domestically focused economy means it is seen as a relative safe haven at a time when investors are worrying about emerging trade wars. India has its own trade headaches — notably its heavy reliance on imported oil, where rising prices have been a key factor behind the growing current account deficit that has helped sap the rupee’s value. Other metrics look more promising, said Sunny Ng, a fund manager at PineBridge Investments, highlighting the country’s “stellar” economic growth of 8.2 per cent in the second quarter. Some recent policy changes have also boosted sentiment, he added, such as a new bankruptcy code that should help boost credit growth by giving added protections to lenders. Overseas investors turn away from Indian stocks Subtitles unavailable In contrast, Indian regulators recently sparked outrage by announcing rules that barred entities owned by Indian-origin people from acting as foreign portfolio investors. An advisory panel has since advised the regulator to reconsider the move, but no reversal has yet been announced. “Whenever the stock market is roaring, the regulators tend to adopt an attitude that we don’t really need foreigners and their money,” Mr Mukherjea said. But while such heavy-handed interventions may unsettle foreign investors, he added, the soaring valuations driven by domestic inflows were having a more meaningful restraining effect on overseas investment. “Foreign investors face a richly valued market at a time when [other emerging markets] have pulled back 20 per cent,” he said. “So if you’re sitting in London, you’ll be hard pressed to explain to your CEO why you’re pumping money into India.” Reuse this content (opens in new window) Comments Jump to comments section Promoted Content Latest on India Behind the Money podcast 23 min listen The unsustainable boom in India’s Silicon Valley India Business Briefing Pakistan, protests and public opinion: Narendra Modi's terrible year Premium content Artificial intelligence Global AI giants target India’s youth in emerging market push India Business Briefing Nandan Nilekani: AI will transform Indian education and agriculture Premium content News in-depth Indian business & finance India’s polo-playing steel tycoon behind bid for Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit US immigration Trump’s H-1B visa turmoil threatens Indians’ American dream FT News Briefing podcast 11 min listen Oracle’s leadership shake-up India Business Briefing Not quite a death knell: India’s tech sector and Trump’s new H-1B rules Premium content Follow the topics in this article Currencies Add to myFT Asia-Pacific equities Add to myFT Indian business & finance Add to myFT Emerging market investing Add to myFT Equities Add to myFT Comments",

    "body": "This Article is From Dec 23, 2018 Indian Stock Market Now Bigger Than Germany's India edged past the equity market of Europes largest economy for the first time in seven years Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email The move reflects India's positive returns this year. India's ascent on the global stage has claimed another victory after its stock market overtook Germany to become the seventh largest in the world. India edged past the equity market of Europe's largest economy for the first time in seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That means, after the UK leaves the European Union in March, the bloc would have only one country -- France -- among the seven biggest markets. India and Germany's market capitalization The move reflects India's positive returns this year as companies' reliance on domestic demand enabled them to avoid the meltdown in other emerging markets spurred by Federal Reserve tightening and a trade war between the U.S. and China. It also highlights the challenges facing the EU, including its future relationship with the UK, a standoff with Italy over budget allocations and separatist clashes in Spain. While the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is heading for a 17 per cent decline this year, India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent after seesawing throughout the year amid oil-price volatility. India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent In a year dominated by trade protectionism and punitive tariffs by Donald Trump's administration on China, it's little wonder that investors have turned cautious over countries with a heavy dependence on exports. Germany derives more than 38 per cent of its gross domestic product from exports, based on 2017 data from World Bank. The corresponding ratio for India is only 11 per cent, meaning much of the stock-market opportunity in the country comes from domestic consumer stories. Add NDTV As A Trusted Source The reliance on local demand and entrepreneurship also puts India ahead in growth sweepstakes. The south Asian nation is projected to grow 7.5 per cent this year and 7.3 per cent in 2019, a far cry from German growth of 1.6 per cent for each year.

    "title": "Global markets wobbled while Indian indices produced a higher return",
    "body": "Investors found that when world stock markets were volatile, India's two indices showed calm with a good return. Historical return, volatility earnings ratio data of last year showed that Indian Stock Market was doing well with respect to various international counterparts including Europe's FTSE and USA's Nasdaq indices. India's most vibrant index Nifty produced 12.18 per cent in a year (as on May 31, 2019). At the same time, global stock markets had been struck with various factors, including slowing world economy, less support from central banks and trade tensions. In this period, Hang Seng index of Hong Kong recorded negative 13.07 per cent followed by Singapore Strait Times index (-10.17 per cent), Japan's Nikkei (-9.21 per cent), Europe' FTSE (-7.49 per cent) and Nasdaq (-2.02 per cent). However, USA's DOW index registered only 0.01 per cent return for the period of June 2018 to May 2019. Investors always look at three factors to balance their investment decisions - returns, volatility and price-earnings ratio; all these factors have favoured Indian indices. Annualised volatility data shows that India's stock indices are less volatile than the world's top stock markets, including the USA'S Nasdaq and China's Shanghai Composite Index. China Shanghai Composite Index is the highest volatile market. Annualised volatility for June, 2018 to May, 2019, the Shanghai Composite index witnessed 21.5 per cent volatility followed by US Nasdaq (19.4 per cent). \"Chinese equity markets are no strangers to large swings. Long-term measures of volatility indicate annual levels near 33 per cent and 54 per cent for offshore and onshore markets respectively\" (based on quarterly data), Standard Chartered Bank said in its global market outlook. The Indian indices -- Sensex and Nifty -- recorded the lowest annualised volatility to 12.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent, respectively, for the period of June, 2018 to May, 2019. \"The performance of Indian capital market compares favourably with the other major global economies on various parameters such as indices returns, volatility and currency movements,\" Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, SEBI, India's capital market regulator said. India also ranked top in the criteria of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which gives an idea to investors that index is over or undervalued. Higher P/E means that higher earnings expectations in the future compared to lower P/E. Indian market recorded top rank in terms of P/E. Nifty P/E ratio at 29.5, which was the highest across the world indices during June, 2018 to May, 2019, Sebi data shows. The growing financial integration with fast cross-border mobility of private capital inflows leads the rally in Indian market experts said that shift in the leverage preference of companies from debt to equity finance. Rajiv Singh, CEO, Karvy stock broking Ltd explains to India Today that \"post demonetisation, domestic inflows have become more robust and domestic institutions have stepped in whenever FII's have sold. The trade war has helped as India is thought of as a safe haven among peers. Lastly, subdued oil prices have helped Indian markets perform better than other EM's\". India has outperformed peers on account of multiple reasons, firstly, the election of a stable reform-oriented government, coupled with the long term growth story for Indian equities has made India an attractive destination for global investors. India has outperformed emerging markets by 5.5 per cent in the last one year, of which 4.5 per cent rally occurred on the day after exit polls were announced. FII inflows are the reason why index heavyweights like HDFC, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Fin, Bajaj Finserve, Reliance, TCS have done well, whereas the broader market has been weak, Rajiv said.",

    "body": "The stock market recovered by half its morning losses as fears gave way to calm in the wake of the Indian attack on posts of Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad. The 30-share BSE Sensex was down 170 points at 1320 IST in today’s session, after having been down over 300 points earlier. As against only four shares being up in the morning, 11 were in the green more than half-way through the session. Tata Motors was the top gainer with a rise of 2.8%, followed by Tata Consultancy Services at 2%. All indices are in the red in today’s trade as investors were spooked by reports that Indian fighter jets had entered Pakistan in the wee hours and destroyed training camps, killing 200-300 terrorists. The BSE Sensex touched a low of 35,714.16 in the ongoing session. According to ANI, the Indian Air Force’s Mirage 2000 fighter jets bombed Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area at 0330 IST. The attack comes 12 days after a bomber belonging to Pakistani terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad killed 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force. As per reports, the terror launch pads of the banned outfit were completely destroyed in the attack. The Indian jets are reported to have returned safely without there being any casualty. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told mediapersons that civilian casualties were avoided, adding that the Indian side had information that the JeM planned more attacks and hence this response had become unavoidable. The strike assumes significance because this is the first time India has used its air force for a pre-emptive strike inside Pakistan. The IAF has put on high alert all air defence systems along the international border and the Line of Control to respond to any possible action by the Pakistan air force.

    "title": "Sensex today falls over 700 points and then recovers all losses",
    "body": "Indian stock markets ended flat in a volatile session, after falling sharply in early trade. Intra-daySensexfell over 700 points when it hit 51,601 at day's low but later ended 21 points higher at 52,344. Similarly, Nifty settled flat at 15,683, after sliding below 15,500 at day's low. The broader markets however ended weak with BSE midcap, smallcap indices falling over 0.7% and 0.9% respectively. The rupee also rebounded today from intra-day losses to settle at 73.86 against US dollar. Avinash Gorakshkar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, attributed the jitteriness in markets to two reasons: Fed changing its stance on interest rate earlier this week and China announcing to use its metal reserves to check metal price rise. Investor also weighed a sharp drop in commodity prices which have been pressured by China's plan to sell reserves and a firm dollar. The Nifty metal index fell nearly 1% today with Vedanta, JSW Steel and SAIL falling over 3% each. \"The market continued to be in the consolidation phase witnessing broad-based selling, taking cues from the Fed policy and mixed global markets. US bond yields have cooled off from its high as global markets seem to have digested the latest Fed comments. China’s plan to sell metal reserves to check recent price hikes has pulled down the sector's sentiments,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. \"The market is likely to continue in the consolidation phase for a short while, which can be an opportunity for investors to buy on dips,\" he added. ONGC was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 4%, followed by NTPC, PowerGrid, M&M, Nestle India, SBI and HCL Tech. On the other hand, HUL, Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finserv were among the gainers. \"Nifty halted a four-week winning streak as it ended the week 0.73% lower. Panic selling has been absorbed well so far in the markets and local investors have taken these sell-offs as an opportunity to add to their positions. Absence of a sharp selloff in global markets is helping keep sentiments steady here. Follow through buying however may be selective and index gains from hereon may be relatively slow. On the upside the Nifty could face resistance at 15750 while 15430 could provide support on downmoves,\" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

SBI shares slid 6.19 per cent to end at Rs 253.70 on the BSE. “Risk of recession increased fuelled by crash in crude oil prices and increasing virus cases outside China. Even though fall in crude oil prices is positive for India in the long term, short term concerns weighed with FII outflow in emerging markets. Coronavirus fear is intensifying and fresh travel bans seems to hurt the global economic sentiments more than feared,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said in an aftermarket statement. Going ahead, the equity markets in India will be shut on Tuesday on account of Holi. The rupee breached the 74-mark against the US dollar as it had opened 25 paise lower against the greenback at 74.03 on Monday. During the intraday trade, it further slipped to 74.18 against the US currency, however, it pared some of its losses and was last seen hovering around 74.05-74.06 levels in late afternoon deals. Oil prices lost as much as a third of their value on Monday in their biggest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War after Saudi Arabia signalled it would hike output to win market share when the coronavirus has already left the market oversupplied. Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling prices and made plans to ramp up crude output next month after Russia balked at making a further steep output cut proposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stabilise oil markets. Brent crude futures were down 22 per cent at $37.05 a barrel by 1000 GMT, after early dropping by as much as 31 per cent to $31.02, their lowest since February 12, 2016.

Global stocks plunged on Monday and prices for crude oil tumbled as much as 33 per cent after Saudi Arabia launched a price war with Russia, sending investors already panicked by the coronavirus fleeing for the safety of bonds and the yen. European markets suffered hefty losses in early trade with London dropping more than 8 per cent, Frankfurt falling more than 7 per cent and Paris almost matching those losses. The pan-regional STOXX 600 tumbled into bear market territory — a drop of more than 20 per cent from recent peaks. The number of people infected with the coronavirus topped 110,000 across the world as the outbreak reached more countries and caused more economic carnage. In Asia, the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 4.4 per cent in its worst day since August 2015, while Shanghai blue chips fell 2.9 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 5.1 per cent and Australia’s commodity-heavy market closed down 7.3 per cent, its biggest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.

The S&PBSE Sensexended at 36,693.69, up 99.36 points (0.27 per cent) while the broader Nifty settled at 10,802.70, up 34.65 points (0.32 per cent).

Financials ended negative while IT and FMCG led the sectoral gains. Markets are hoping for further stimulus measures from the RBI, following expectations of a softening ofinflationrates, which would give RBI room for further rate cuts. Investors are advised to be cautious and to look at stock specific movements with regards to earnings announcements and the commentary,”Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said in a statement. The rupee settled on a flat note at 75.19 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday amid high volatility in the domestic equity market.

    "title": "Market cap of BSE firms hits a record $3 trillion as stocks rally",
    "body": "India’s stock market capitalization hit $3 trillion on Friday, fuelled by a rally in small and mid-cap stocks on the BSE. This comes even as the BSE Sensex remains 4% below its February peak, pulled down by large-cap stocks that make the benchmark index. In rupee terms, India’s current market value is pegged at₹218.05 trillion, raising investors’ wealth by₹30.01 trillion or $42.01 billion this year, despite pandemic worries and localized curbs affecting sentiments. In May itself, the market cap of BSE companies swelled by₹11.03 trillion or $19.62 billion. After two days of lacklustre trading following weak global equities, markets rallied on Friday, encouraged by easing covid concerns and a strengthening rupee. The Sensex closed 975.62 points or 1.97% higher at 50,540.48, while the Nifty ended 269.25 points or 1.81% higher at 15,175.30. At closing, the BSE had a market capitalization of $2.99 trillion. The only other countries that have a stock market capitalization of more than $3 trillion are the US, China, Hong Kong, Japan, UK, France, and Canada. BSE’s record market capitalization comes at a time when foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been dumping Indian equities. Since 23 March, FIIs have sold Indian shares worth nearly $2.48 billion. However, domestic institutional investors, including mutual funds and insurance companies, continue to invest, thanks to abundant liquidity and optimism about mid- and small-cap stocks. According to analysts, the Nifty and the Sensex have been consolidating since mid-January, driving liquidity into midcap and small-cap segments. Also, with most large-caps fairly valued, value investors started moving down the market cap pyramid. From their 52-week lows, BSE MidCap has advanced 92%, BSE Smallcap 121% and BSE 500 75%. “As domestic covid cases fell below the three-lakh mark for the fifth day in a row since mid-April, helped by the extended lockdowns by major states, sentiments have turned buoyant. Hopes have accelerated that soon restrictions/curbs would be eased once cases decline further. Visibility on the economic recovery front improved as industrial activities largely continued even during the lockdown, and now, with restrictions likely to ease, consumer demand is expected to make a comeback. Thus, investors are heading more for mid-cap stocks as growing risk appetite, and cheaper valuations of these companies compared to large-cap peers have revived their popularity,” said Siddharth Khemka, head of retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The March quarter performance of good mid-cap and small-cap companies were also way ahead of Street estimates despite rising input costs, mostly due to higher revenues and various cost control measures. Analysts expect earnings to support the market valuation further while keeping an eye on covid-19 cases and vaccination progress. “India’s valuation premium with respect to MSCI emerging markets has remained stable at 40-45% over the last four months, indicating that the rally has been a global one. The headline valuations for the Nifty Midcap 100 suggest that we are in an acceptable zone that can act as a platform for the broader markets to do better from hereon. Midcaps in a growing market with market leadership and low leverage can be equally attractive investment option as any large-cap,” Tata Mutual Fund said. Meanwhile, the rupee rose for the second straight day to close at a two-month high. The domestic currency closed at 72.84 against the US dollar from its previous close of 73.11.

    "title": "With $3.16674 trillion MCap, Indian stock market beats its British peer",
    "body": "India has outgrown the United Kingdom in terms of market capitalisation for the first time to become the sixth biggest stock market amid a sustained slump in global equities triggered by the Russian onslaught on Ukraine. India’s market cap stood at $3.16674 trillion on Thursday as against $3.1102 trillion for the UK, according to Bloomberg data. India lost nearly $357.05 billion in market cap (MCap) since the geopolitical tensions flared up last month, while the British markets suffered an erosion of $410 billion since February 1. The US is the world's biggest market with an MCap of $46.01 trillion followed by China at $11.31 trillion, Japan at $5.78 trillion, Hong Kong at 5.50 trillion, and Saudi Arabia at $3.25 trillion. In Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest exporter of crude oil, stock markets saw a jump in MCap after crude oil surged to historic levels. It added around $442 billion in MCap in the last one month. World markets swung back in the black in the last two sessions after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was no longer pressing for the NATO membership. On Thursday, Indian markets opened in the green with a close watch on the outcome of poll results in five states. Crude oil, too, took a breather from the rally on hopes of positive talks in a meeting of foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia scheduled on Thursday in Turkey. \"The recent rebound (in Indian markets) is in line with the global counterparts and it would be too early to call it a reversal. Besides, the geopolitical updates, domestic factors like state election results will also be in focus. We expect volatility to remain high, so participants should prefer hedged trades,\" said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research at Religare Broking. The Indian equity markets gained for the third session after a four-day losing streak. This was also the second best session since Russia's invasion on Ukraine on February 24. Both the benchmark Sensex and Nifty have lost nearly 6 percent, while both fell 6.2 percent so far this year. Year to date, foreign investors sold around $14.20 billion in the local equity markets. With more central bank meetings coming up in the next week, analysts expect headline indices to move primarily based on macro news. Discover the latestBusiness News,Sensex, andNiftyupdates.

Yet one year on, the technology titan has lost a whopping $344 billion in market capitalization -- the biggest wipe-out of shareholder value globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

    "body": "Market Today, Sensex, Nifty Share Prices Updates:The frontline indices on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE) fell for the third consecutive session, ending nearly 1.5 per cent lower on Tuesday triggered by cross-sector selloff tracking weakness in the global market. The S&PBSE Sensexcrashed 843.79 points (1.46 per cent) to end at 57,147.32 while theNifty 50slumped 257.45 points (1.49 per cent) to settle below the 17,000-level mark at 16,983.55. Both the indices had opened around 0.25 per cent lower earlier in the day and traded in a range during the morning session. However, they slumped in the late afternoon deals with the Sensex hitting an intraday low of 57,050.40 and the broader Nifty touching 16,950.30. On the Sensex pack,IndusIndBank,Nestle India,Tata Steel,Tech Mahindra,Infosys, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Titan Company, Reliance Industries (RIL),Maruti SuzukiIndia, Hindustan Unilever (HUL),WiproandHCL Technologieswere the top losers on Tuesday, falling 2.00-3.70 per cent. Only Axis Bank andAsian Paintsmanaged to end around 1 per cent higher. All the sectoral indices on NSE ended lower on Tuesday. Nifty Realty cracked 3.07 per cent, Nifty Metal fell 2.20 per cent, Nifty Media slumped 2.02 per cent and Nifty IT declined 1.99 per cent. In the broader market, the S&P BSE MidCap index fell 406.29 points (1.61 per cent) to close at 24,757.61 while the S&P BSE SmallCap slumped 425.18 points (1.47 per cent) to end at 28,589.23. On NSE, the volatility index or India VIX surged 4.42 per cent to 20.49. “India’s outperformance till date made a case for profit booking for the FIIs today as geopolitical and currency risks came to the forefront. Practically all sectoral indices ended in the red with the Nifty closing below 17,000 on a day when nothing was spared. The broader markets too saw a steep correction in several stocks which have been defying gravity and moving up since the past several weeks,” said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities. Commenting on the market mood, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Investors are becoming risk-averse due to rising geopolitical turmoil as well as worries about the global economic slump. Investors’ caution ahead of the announcement ofinflationdata prevented a better-than-expected start to IT earnings from improving market mood. However, as compared to global counterparts, domestic selling is not as aggressive since FII selling is primarily absorbed by DIIs.” Asian and European shares were mostly lower Tuesday as losses in the technology sector weighed on global benchmarks. France’s CAC 40 dipped 0.6 per cent to 5,807.12. Germany’s DAX lost 0.7 per cent to 12,183.60. Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.2 per cent to 6,878.65.

Taiwan dropped 4.4 per cent after reopening from a holiday in the first trading session since the US imposed new limits on exports of semiconductors and chip-making equipment to China. TMSC, the world’s biggest chipmaker, plunged 8.3 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 declined 2.6 per cent to 26,401.25. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.8 per cent to 2,192.07. Both markets also were reopening after holidays on Monday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.2 per cent to 16,830.73. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2 per cent to 2,979.79, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3 per cent to 6,645.00. Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed. The brothers Provit and Sorbojit Thaosen were among the victims, along with four others from their village.

    "body": "The market is expected to open in the green as trends in the SGX Nifty indicate a positive opening for the broader index in India with a gain of 73 points. The BSE Sensex was down 221 points to 60,286, while the Nifty50 fell 43 points to 17,722 at the close on Tuesday and formed bearish candle on the daily charts with lower-high-lower-low formation, indicating temporary weakness in the market. As per the pivot charts, the key support level for the Nifty is seen at 17,668, followed by 17,630, and 17,570. If the index moves up, the key resistance levels to watch out for are 17,789, followed by 17,826 and 17,887. Stay tuned to Moneycontrol to find out what happens in the currency and equity markets today. We have collated a list of important headlines across news platforms which could impact Indian as well as international markets: US stocks rallied to a convincingly higher close on Tuesday, but trade was choppy as investors digested comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about how long the central bank might need to tame inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 265.67 points, or 0.78 percent, to 34,156.69, the S&P 500 gained 52.92 points, or 1.29 percent, to 4,164 and the Nasdaq Composite added 226.34 points, or 1.9 percent, to 12,113.79. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell overnight acknowledged that inflation is declining — a sign the central bank may soon pause its rate hikes. The Nikkei 225 fell 0.34 percent, while the Topix gained 0.12 percent. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.68 percent. Trends in the SGX Nifty indicate a positive opening for the broader index in India with a gain of 73 points. The Nifty futures were trading around 17,803 levels on the Singaporean exchange. All eyes will be on RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das when he unveils the outcome of the crucial monetary policy review, the last one for this fiscal, and the first one in this calendar year. Most experts feel that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will hike the key policy rate by 25 basis points, while economists at SBI say that the central bank may hit the pause button, maintaining the current 'withdrawal of accommodation' stance. A host of factors will determine the MPC decision. Oil surges more than 3% as Fed's Powell eases rate hike concerns Oil prices climbed more than 3 percent on Tuesday after the head of the US central bank eased market concerns over interest rate hikes, while recovering demand in China also boosted prices. Brent crude futures were up $2.70, or 3.3 percent, to $83.69 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose $3.03, or 4.1 percent, to $77.14 per barrel. Inflation starting to slow but long, 'bumpy' road ahead: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell US inflation is starting to cool but the road ahead will likely be long and bumpy, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Tuesday, adding that stronger-than-expected economic data could bring more rate hikes. The US central bank has in recent months tempered its aggressive campaign to rein in surging inflation, opting for smaller increases to the benchmark lending rate after multiple steep hikes. \"If the data were to continue to come in stronger than we expect, and we were to conclude that we needed to raise rates more... then we would certainly do that,\" Powell said. Moody's says Indian banks' exposures to Adani 'not large enough' The risk to Indian banks due to the rout faced by Adani stocks are \"limited\", Moody's Investor Services said in a report released on February 7. The exposure of country's lenders to the embattled business group is \"not large enough\", it noted. The ratings' agency, however, underlined that risks for banks can increase if Adani \"becomes more reliant on bank loans\". The group's access to funding from international markets can be curtailed \"because of heightened risk perception\", Moody's said, adding that in such a case, domestic banks may become the main source of funding. This, in turn, may result in \"increases in banks' exposures to Adani and greater risks for them\", it noted. Results on February 8 Shree Cement, Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, Cummins India, Escorts Kubota, Dreamfolks Services, Endurance Technologies, Equitas Small Finance Bank, GATI, Gujarat Pipavav Port, Graphite India, HG Infra Engineering, Honeywell Automation India, IRCON International, ITD Cementation India, Minda Corporation, Samvardhana Motherson International, Narayana Hrudayalaya, Oberoi Realty, Piramal Enterprises, Speciality Restaurants, Symphony, Tracxn Technologies, Trent, and Windlas Biotech will be in focus ahead of its quarterly earnings on February 8. Foreign institutional investors (FII) sold shares worth Rs 2,559.96 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DII) purchased shares worth Rs 639.82 crore on February 7, as per provisional data available on the NSE. Stocks under F&O ban on NSE The National Stock Exchange has added Ambuja Cements on its F&O ban list for February 8, but removed Adani Ports from the same list. Securities thus banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts have crossed 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.

    "body": "The Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Sensex crashing 2,300 points in five days, down by 1.32%. This decline was influenced by a combination of global and domestic factors, creating selling pressure in the market. The Nifty 50 briefly hovered below the 23,000 level, down by 0.41 % before recovering. Investors have lost nearly ₹ 18 lakh crore in five days, marking a brutal week for them in the market. Aggressive FPI Selling:Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have been selling Indian stocks since October, leading to significant outflows from the market. This selling is attributed to: Global Trade War Fears:Tensions arising fromUS President Donald Trump'stariff policies have heightened concerns about a global trade war. These issues also acted as a major contribution to the FPi withdrawal from India. Weak Q3 Earnings:The earnings reports for the December quarter (Q3) of India Inc. have not met expectations, raising concerns regarding their growth prospects. This, along with steep valuations, adds to the market jitters. Valuation Concerns:Despite the recent market correction, there are still worries that the Indian stock market is overvalued. As of February 12, 2025, the ratio of India's total market capitalization to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stands at 114.46%, indicating a \"modestly overvalued\" status. This assessment is based on the Buffett Indicator, which compares market capitalization to GDP to gauge valuation levels. Disclaimer:This news is solely for educational purposes.

    "title": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Israel-Iran news; eight stocks to buy or sell on Thursday",
    "body": "Stock market today: The benchmark Nifty-50 index managed to end above the level of 25,200, settling at 25,244.75, with gains of 0.80% on Wednesday. Bank Nifty at 56,621.15 also ended 0.28% higher as all indices ended with gains led by Auto, IT, and FMCG. Even mid- and small caps ended with gains of 0.44 to 1.49%. For the Nifty-50 Index, now, 25000 and 25100 would act as key support zones, and above these levels, the bullish sentiment may continue. On the higher side, 25300 would act as an immediate resistance, while above this could push the market towards 25450-25500, as per Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research, Kotak Securities. Bank Nifty has retraced more than 80% of its recent breather (57049-55149),, andmomentumremains firmly positive above the 55,400 zone, as per Bajaj Broking. Investors would now await the US Q1 GDP data, scheduled for release on Thursday, which could provide insights into the US economic growth trajectory. On the domestic front, investors would focus on financials. Monsoon-linked sectors are also expected to be in the spotlight as rainfall trends improve, said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research,WealthManagement,Motilal Oswal Financial ServicesLtd. The capital market-related stocks are expected to benefit from heightened activity in the broader market and a robust IPO pipeline. Overall, Khemka expects the Indian market to remain firm on the back of reduced global geopolitical concerns and positive domestic cues. Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, has recommended two stock picks for today. Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, suggested three stocks, while Shiju Koothupalakkal, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, has given three stock picks. These includeJubilant FoodWorksLtd.,BirlasoftLtd.,State Bank of India, Ambuja Cements Ltd.,Tata ChemicalsLtd., Greaves Cotton Ltd., Swiggy Ltd., andGujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd. JUBLFOOD is currently trading at₹713, having recently rebounded from a key support zone. The stock has successfully broken above a recent swing high of₹702, forming a bullish candlestick on the daily timeframe, which signals a potential trend reversal. This bullish setup is further supported by rising trading volumes, indicating strong buying interest and renewed market participation. 2. Birlasoft Ltd.—Bagadia recommends buyingBSOFTat around₹443.65, keeping stop-loss at₹428 for a target price of₹475 BSOFT is currently trading at₹443.65 and has recently given a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This breakout, supported by a strong bullish candlestick and a notable surge in trading volume, signals robust bullish momentum and reinforces the positive technical outlook. The stock is now eyeing the immediate resistance at₹450. A sustained move and close above this level would further validate the breakout and open the path for an upside move towards the short-term target of₹475. 3. State Bank of India (SBI)—Dongre recommends buying SBI at around₹800, keeping stop-loss at₹775 for a target price of₹830. A short-term trend analysis of the stock reveals encouraging technical signals that suggest a potential bullish reversal. On the short-term chart, a prominent bullish engulfing candlestick pattern has emerged, signaling a shift in momentum from selling pressure to buying interest. Adding strength to this view, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently entered the oversold zone, indicating that the stock may be poised for a rebound from current levels. This confluence of technical indicators increases the likelihood of a near-term price retracement. 4.Ambuja CementsLtd.—Dongre recommends buying Ambuja Cements or AMBUJACEM at around₹560, keeping stop-loss at₹552 for a target price of₹575 In the recent short-term trend analysis, the stock has shown signs of a potential bullish retracement, supported by emerging technical indicators. A reversal pattern on the chart suggests the possibility of an upward move, with a near-term target around Rs.575. 5. Tata Chemicals Ltd.—Dongre recommends buying Tata Chemicals, or TATACHEM, at around₹940, keeping stop-loss at₹910 for a target price of₹985. A recent short-term analysis of the stock reveals the emergence of a bullish reversal pattern on the chart, indicating a possible near-term price rebound. This formation suggests the potential for a move towards the Rs.985 level, supported by improving price action. 6. Greaves Cotton Ltd.—Koothupalakkal recommends buyingGREAVES COTTONat around₹203.70 for a target price of₹215, keeping Stop loss at₹198 The stock has indicated a rising trend with a series of higher lows formation on the daily chart, currently having a bullish candle to improve the bias and anticipating a further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI has indicated a positive trend reversal to signal a buy, and there is much upside potential visible from the current rate. With the chart technically looking good, we suggest buying the stock. 7. Swiggy Ltd.—Koothupalakkal recommends buying SWIGGY at around₹399.90 for a target price of₹420, keeping a Stop loss at₹392 The stock, after indicating a breakout above the inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily chart at the₹375 zone, has maintained the strong uptrend and is steadily on the rise with further upward movement anticipated in the coming sessions. The volume participation is on the rise, and with the RSI showing strength, there is scope for further positive move. With the chart technically looking attractive, we suggest buying the stock. 8. Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd.-Koothupalakkal recommends buyingGujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals, or GSFC, at around₹203 for a target price of₹215, keeping stop loss at₹198 The stock has recently taken support near the 100-period moving average at the₹192 level and indicated a decent pullback to move past the 200-period MA at the₹201 level to strengthen the bias expecting further rise. The volume participation has been significant, with the RSI indicating a positive trend reversal to signal a buy, carrying on with the positive move further ahead in the coming sessions. With the chart looking good, we suggest buying the stock. Disclaimer:The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies and not of Mint.

Read Time: 2 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Sensex lost 3,939.68 points in early trade New Delhi: Indian shares continued to fall sharply on Monday, with the Sensex and Nifty crashing about 5 per cent in early trade, mirroring a sharp fall in global equities. Sensex, a pack of India's top 30 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, lost 3,939.68 points or 5.22 per cent to 71,425.01, while Nifty, the National Stock Exchange index, dropped 1,160.8 points or 5.06 per cent to 21,743.65. The collapse reportedly wiped out investors' wealth worth Rs 20.16 lakh crore in early trade. Other Asian markets also slumped, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping nearly 11 per cent, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunging nearly 7 per cent, Shanghai SSE Composite index tumbling over 6 per cent, and South Korea's Kospi index declining 5 per cent. Last week, the Sensex sank 2,050.23 points or 2.64 per cent, while the Nifty dropped 614.8 points or 2.61 per cent. Why Indian Stock Market Is Down Today The Indian stock market crashed as US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes and retaliation from China fuelled investors' jitters amid fears that a full-blown trade war will impact economic growth across the world. President Trump has sparked a market meltdown after he unveiled sweeping tariffs against US trading partners last week. China also hit back, saying it would impose retaliatory levies of 34 percent on all US goods from April 10. The tit-for-tat moves have now raised concerns of a prolonged trade war . \"Reciprocal tariffs, even if temporary, highlight the increased uncertainty for companies and investors,\" Reuters quoted Kotak Institutional Equities analyst Sanjeev Prasad as saying. \"The performance of Indian markets in the next few weeks will depend on whether there is a reconciliation or retaliation in the tariff situation and behaviour of India's retail and domestic institutional investors,\" he said. VK Vijayakumar, the Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said that the markets globally are going through \"heightened volatility caused by extreme uncertainty\". Add NDTV As A Trusted Source \"No one has a clue about how this turbulence caused by Trump's tariffs will evolve. Wait and watch would be the best strategy in this turbulent phase of the market,\" he was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.

    "title": "Why is Indian stock market falling? — explained with five reasons",
    "body": "Stock market news:TheIndian stock markethas fallen for five straight sessions. Among the frontline indices, the Nifty 50 index today made an intraday low of 24,210 and lost 590 points in this period. Today, the BSE Sensex made an intraday low of 79,477 and lost 1,866 points in these five sessions. Today, the Bank Nifty index made an intraday low of 50,559 and lost around 2,060 points in these five sessions. According tostock marketexperts, the Indian stock market has been under pressure for the last five sessions as global trends are trading weak. They said that Dalal Street had high expectations from the Union Budget 2024. Still, the Modi 3.0 Government's first budget was just an extension of the interim budget, and there was nothing to cheer the Indian stock market, which was trading at a record high. Apart from this, below-par Q1 results in 2024, FIIs and DIIs selling, and weakglobal marketsentiments are some other reasons that are dragging the Indian stock market these days. 1] Budget 2024:\"There was no surprise in the Budget 2024 as it was a mere extension of the interim budget presented in February. The market was expecting some major announcements that would have boosted the CAPEX expansion plans of the corporate sector. So, the budget is expected to put the companies' earnings under pressure in the entire FY25. This selling in the Indian share market can be attributed to this shortfall in the Indian stock market,\" said Saurabh Jain, Vice President — Research atSMC Global Securities. 2] Q1 results 2024:\"The market is discounting the Union Budget 2024, and the focus is now shifting to the trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has remained marginally below our expectations so far in 1QFY25,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal. 3] Weak global market trends:\"After weak Quarterly numbers from US tech giants Tesla and Alphabet, the US stock market witnessed strong selling pressure, which has trickled down in other global bourses. Asian and European markets are also under pressure due to Gernamy's manufacturing woes. So, weak global cues are also a reason for the fall in the Indian stock market,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities. 4] Trend reversal by anchors:\"To date, DIIs were the anchors of the Indian stock market, but they are also on the selling side these days. So, both FIIs and DIIs are selling their position, which is also a reason for the slide in the Indian stock market,\" said Saurabh Jain of SMC Global Securities. 5] Lowering demand of premium buyers:\"In FY24, we witnessed a rise in premium care and other luxury item sales, but those sales have also decreased in the first quarter of the current fiscal. This means the premium class's purchasing power capacity has decreased after showing some signs of recovery,\" said Saurabh Jain.

    "title": "Stock market crash: Sensex tumbles 700 points; what drove the Indian stock market down today?",
    "body": "Stock market today:A day after clocking a strong gain of nearly 2 per cent, Indian stock market benchmarks—the Sensex and the Nifty 50—suffered significant losses on Friday, January 3, due to profit booking amid the strengthening US dollar. The BSE benchmark Sensex opened at 80,072.99 against its previous close of 79,943.71 and fell 834 points to an intra-day low of 79,109.73. However, the 30-pack index recouped some losses and closed 721 points, or 0.90 per cent, down at 79,223.11. Meanwhile, its NSE counterpart, the Nifty 50 opened at 24,196.40 against its previous close of 24,188.65 and dropped 213 points, or 0.90 per cent, to 23,976 during the session. At close, the index was 184 points, or 0.76 per cent, down at 24,004.75. Mid and small-cap indices outperformed the benchmarks. The BSE Midcap index slipped 0.33 per cent, while the BSE Smallcap index, down 0.02 per cent, closed almost flat. Bank, financial, IT and pharma packs suffered strong losses today. Nifty Bank fell 1.20 per cent, while the Nifty Financial Services index dropped 1.13 per cent. The Nifty Private Bank index declined 0.90 per cent, but the Nifty PSU Bank index rose 0.31 per cent. Nifty IT (down 1.41 per cent), Pharma (down 1.23 per cent) and Healthcare (down 1.16 per cent) lost over a per cent. Experts have highlighted the following five key factors that might be behind the Indian stock market's decline. Take a look: Experts pointed out that profit booking in select heavyweights, including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, TCS, Zomato and ITC was the primary reason behind the downturn in the benchmark indices. Investors are booking profits in these stocks as concerns over stretched valuation and weak earnings persist while global uncertainty also weighs on sentiment. As per analysts, investors remain cautious ahead of Q3 earnings and amid anticipation of major policy shifts in the US administration afterDonald Trumptakes charge. They underscored that the market might see occasional gains due to short covering, but a decisive move could only be expected after the December quarter earnings start coming out. “Despite the short recovery in the past two sessions, markets lost the momentum as there is still a lot of pessimism due to slowing growth, higher domestic valuations, foreign fund outflows, and uncertainty over US trade policies post Trump's resumption as the country's president. Hence, markets may see bouts of correction, and investors will continue to maintain caution while keeping an eye on global developments,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP -Research at Mehta Equities. According to Reuters, the dollar was at a two-year high against a basket of currencies amid concerns that the US interest rates will stay higher for a longer period. Significant gain in the dollar index is weighing on sentiment in emerging markets like India. A strong US dollar may accelerate foreign capital outflow from the Indian market. \"With the dollar index at 109.25 and the US 10-year yield at 4.56 per cent, the macro construct is not favourable for sustained FII buying,\" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, observed. Banking, financial and IT sectors have significant weight in the benchmark index. When they fall, they drag the key indices down. On Friday, the Nifty IT, Nifty Bank and Financial Services indices dropped over 1 per cent each. These sectors are witnessing profit booking even though experts expect theirDecember quarter numbersto improve quarter-on-quarter. Experts expect the market to experiencevolatilityin January ahead of theUS Fed policydecision,Union Budget 2025and the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy. The US Fed's policy meeting is scheduled for January 28-29. Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamanwill present the Union Budget 2025 on February 1, while the RBI MPC will meet to decide on policy rates on February 5-7. Apart from these, the Trump factor will also keep the market jittery. Donald Trump will assume office onJanuary 20. His policies on tariffs and work visas will be the focus of investors globally.

    "body": "03/01/25 | 4:34 pm | Indian stock market | Nifty | Sensex Share Indian stock market declines as cautious sentiment prevails After a strong start to the New Year, the Indian stock market stumbled on Friday, weighed down by losses in key sectors like IT, financial services, and pharmaceuticals. Weak global cues added to investor unease, halting the recent upward momentum. The Sensex dropped 720.60 points, or 0.90%, to close at 79,223.11, while the Nifty ended at 24,004.75, down 183.90 points or 0.76%. The Nifty Bank index fell by 1.20%, finishing at 50,988.8. Midcaps and small caps also faced pressure, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index down 0.30% at 57,931.05 and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index slipping 0.24% to close at 19,033.70. Market analysts attributed the downturn to investor caution amid uncertainties about upcoming earnings and weaker-than-expected economic data. IT, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and banking stocks were among the hardest hit. Despite broad declines, some sectors showed resilience. PSU Banks, FMCG, Metals, Media, Energy, and Commodities sectors posted gains. Among Sensex stocks, major losers included HDFC Bank, Zomato, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HCL Tech, and Bharti Airtel. Meanwhile, Tata Motors, Titan, Hindustan Unilever, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC, Nestle India, IndusInd Bank, and Tata Steel emerged as gainers. On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the market breadth was slightly positive, with 2,115 stocks advancing, 1,871 declining, and 117 remaining unchanged. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) purchased equities worth ₹1,506.75 crore on January 2, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought ₹22.14 crore worth of stocks, indicating continued interest in Indian markets despite the dip. According to Rupak De of LKP Securities, Nifty failed to break above its 50-day exponential moving average, leading to the correction. “On the upside, if Nifty manages to breach the 24,220 mark, it could rise further towards 24,500. Conversely, a fall below 24,000 may pull the index down to 23,700,” he said.",

    "title": "Indian stock market: Sensex, Nifty 50 rise despite HMPV virus fears. Will the rally sustain?",
    "body": "Indian stock market benchmarks—theSensexand theNifty 50—recorded decent gains on Tuesday, January 7, ending their two-day losing streak. The Sensex closed 234 points, or 0.30 per cent, higher at 78,199.11, while the Nifty 50 ended with a gain of 92 points, or 0.39 per cent, at 23,707.90. The rally was stronger in the mid and small-cap segments as the BSE Midcap index climbed 0.77 per cent and Smallcap index rose 1.74 per cent. The overall market capitalisation of the BSE-listed firms rose to nearly₹442 lakh crore from about₹439 lakh crore, making investors richer by about₹3 lakh crore in a single session. In the last two sessions, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 had fallen over 2 per cent each, primarily because of sustained selling by foreign institutional investors amid a sustained rise in the US bond yields and rising cases of the HMPV virus. Market sentiment received a fresh blow after concerns emerged over the spread of theHMPV virus, reminding the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. As Mint reported, Indian authorities confirmed the detection of several human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases on Monday amid growing concern about the respiratory virus. Two cases were reported from Bengaluru in Karnataka, while a third tested positive after being hospitalised in Gujarat. The development comes even as China and other countries battle a major viral fever and pneumonia outbreak. Track Live Updates of HMPV CasesHere While the spread of HMPV cases remains in the focus of investors, the Indian stock market witnessed a relief rally on Tuesday, with the Sensex rising nearly 500 points during the session. The market witnessedbuyingat lower levels as reports of the virus not being as fatal as COVID-19 emerged. The government has clarified that people should take precautions but not be highly worried about the virus, as the infection is a seasonal disease. “Health experts have clarified that HMPV is not a new virus. It was first identified in 2001, and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years. HMPV spreads through the air through respiration. This can affect persons of all age groups. The virus spreads more during the winter and the early spring months,\" Health MinisterJP Naddasaid on Monday. Experts believe the sharp fall of over 1 per cent in the previous session was an overreaction to the HMPV virus cases. \"The 1.6 per cent cut in the Nifty 50 yesterday appears to be an overreaction to the HMPV virus concerns. Clarification by the government that there is no room for undue concern from the virus, which is not new, can facilitate a rebound in the market, led by momentum stocks,\" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Investors are using the dip to buy fundamentally strong and beaten-down stocks in many segments. Largely positive global cues also influenced sentiment back home. Several major Asian markets saw healthy buying on Tuesday amid reports that the incoming US President-elect,Donald Trump, could adopt a less aggressive tariff stance. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that Trump's aides were exploring tariff plans covering only certain sectors considered critical to national or economic security. Trump, however, later declined this report. At this point, it seems highly unlikely that the market will sustain the rally. Significant uncertainty surrounds how India Inc.'s Q3 earnings will unfold, the trade policies Trump will announce after assuming office on January 20, and the rate at which virus cases will rise. \"It doesn’t look like it will sustain as the global macros are not favourable. Also, if we consider our currency, it is weakening on a daily basis. This is compelling FIIs to reduce their exposure, and we think it will continue at least until America’s President takes the oath. Volatility will remain with a negative bias,\" said Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities. \"I don't think the market will sustain the current gains. The business updates of some banking heavyweights, such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, were lower than expectations. This signals the Q3 earnings seasons could come softer. There are also risks of yen-carry trade if Japan's central bank increases interest rates,\" said Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President of Research at Mehta Equities. Tapse believes the domestic market will remain volatile in January due to Q3 earnings, the Trump factor and the upcoming Union Budget 2025. The news flow surrounding virus cases will also influence the sentiment of retail investors and HNIs. \"Investors should wait and watch for Q3 earnings. If the December quarter results turn out to be better than that of the last two quarters, investors may consider buying quality stocks at that point,\" said Tapse. The stretched valuation of the Indian stock market remains a concern. Despite the recent correction, experts still believe the market lacks valuation comfort. Any disappointment on the earnings front will make the market fall further. \"While we remain bullish on the Nifty over the next two years, we view the index as fairly priced with a temporary downward bias of approximately 8–10 per cent,\"Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager at Invasset PMS, told Mint.

    "body": "Indian stock market: The domestic equity market indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open higher on Tuesday tracking mixed global market cues. Asian markets traded largely higher, while the US stock market ended mixed overnight, with selling seen in tech stocks. On Monday, the Indian stock market crashed amid heavy selloff across sectors led by rising crude oil prices, depreciating rupee and sustained foreign capital outflows. TheSensexcracked 1,048.90 points, or 1.36%, to close at 76,330.01, while the Nifty 50 settled 345.55 points, or 1.47%, lower at 23,085.95. “Wide-spread selling across the sectors fuelled along with massive exits in mid and small-cap stocks further worsened the sentiment. Rising crude oil prices would raise concerns of a spike in domestic inflation, which could further delay any rate cut hopes from the RBI in the near to medium term,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded mixed on Tuesday tracking a similar trend overnight on Wall Street. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.73% and the Topix dropped 0.34%. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.4%, while the Kosdaq declined 0.62%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures indicated a higher opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 23,280 level, a premium of nearly 118 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a gap-up start for the Indian stock market indices.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 358.67 points, or 0.86%, to 42,297.12, while the S&P 500 rose 9.18 points, or 0.16%, to 5,836.22.

India’sretail inflationeased to a four-month low in December, driven by moderation in food prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based retail inflation rose 5.22% in December, down from 5.48% in November and 5.69% a year ago. HCL Technologies reported a net profit of₹4,591 crore in Q3FY25, up by 8.4% QoQ.

HCL Tech also declared an interim dividend of₹12 per share and a special dividend of₹6 per share. Strong growth in tax collection from both personal and corporate income helped the Central government to collect₹16.9 trillion indirect tax revenueso far this financial year after adjusting for tax refunds, official data showed.

    "body": "10/01/25 | 4:41 pm Share Indian stock markets decline for third consecutive day; IT sector gains Indian stock markets closed lower for the third consecutive session on Friday, as concerns over President-elect Donald Trump’s potential policies dampened investor sentiment. The Sensex closed at 77,378.91 points, down 241.30 points or 0.31 percent, while the Nifty ended at 23,440.00 points, declining by 86.50 points or 0.37 percent. Both indices recorded a weekly decline of 2 percent. Foreign investor selling and sluggish domestic economic growth added to the downward pressure on markets. Sectoral performance was mostly negative, with Nifty IT being the only sector to post gains, closing 3.44 percent higher. Sectors such as media, PSU banks, and realty were the worst performers. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, remarked that the prevailing uncertainty surrounding potential U.S. policies and continued foreign institutional investor (FII) selling would likely keep the market subdued in the near term. He also noted that the ongoing corporate earnings season would lead to stock-specific movements. The IT sector, buoyed by the performance of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), stood out amidst the market downturn. TCS reported a 12 percent year-on-year increase in net profit for the October-December quarter, reaching ₹12,444 crore. Revenue from operations rose to ₹63,973 crore, marking a 5.6 percent growth compared to the same period last year. TCS shares rose by 5.6 percent, closing at ₹4,265, contributing to the gains in the Nifty IT index. Vijayakumar added that while banking sector results are expected to be strong, FII outflows may dampen the sector’s performance in the market. According to Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, Indian markets underperformed compared to most global markets. Chouhan suggested that upcoming inflation data would be a key macroeconomic indicator to watch. The corporate earnings season, which began with TCS’s results, is expected to provide further cues for market participants in the coming weeks.",

    "body": "Indian stock market: The domestic equity market indices, Sensex and Nifty 50 are expected to open lower on Monday following weakness in global markets. Asian markets declined, while the US stock market ended lower last Friday, with Wall Street’s main indexes closing their second consecutive week in the red. The S&P 500 erased its 2025 gains after stronger-than-expected US jobs data reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates elevated for longer than traders were betting on. Markets are now pricing in a single Fed rate cut no sooner than June. This week, investors will closely monitor keystock market triggers, including the Q3 results, domestic and global macroeconomic data, trends in US dollar and Treasury yields, flow of foreign funds, crude oil prices and other key global cues. On Friday, the Indian stock market ended lower, extending its losing streak for the third consecutive session. TheSensexdeclined 241.30 points, or 0.31%, to close at 77,378.91, while the Nifty 50 settled 95.00 points, or 0.4%, lower at 23,431.50. “Markets continued its downward trajectory as rupee scaling new lows due to strengthening dollar has further dampened investors’ sentiment. Amid concerns of subdued economic growth and expectations of a slowdown in the quarterly earnings, investors cut their bet on banking and mid & small cap stocks. With expensive valuations of Indian markets at large still a concern, investors would mostly resort to stock specific activities,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded lower tracking losses on Wall Street after a strong US jobs report. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.4%. Japanese markets are closed for a holiday. South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.4%, while the Kosdaq dropped 0.3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures indicated a lower opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 23,340 level, a discount of nearly 160 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a negative start for the Indian stock market today. US stock marketended lower on Friday after an upbeat jobs report stoked fresh inflation fears. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 696.75 points, or 1.63%, to 41,938.45, while the S&P 500 declined 91.21 points, or 1.54%, to 5,827.04. The Nasdaq Composite ended 317.25 points, or 1.63%, lower at 19,161.63. Nvidia shares dropped 3%, while Advanced Micro Devices stock price fell 4.76% and Apple share price declined 2.41%. Constellation Energy stock jumped 25.16%, while Constellation Brands tanked 17.09%. Walgreens Boots Alliance stock price soared 27.55% US job growth unexpectedly accelerated in December. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 jobs last month, the most since March, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Data for October and November was revised to show 8,000 fewer jobs added than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 160,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 120,000 to 200,000. The US unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December from 4.2% in November. The jobless rate averaged 4.0% last year compared to 3.6% in 2023. India’s foreign exchange (forex) reserves plunged for the fifth consecutive week to hit a 10-month low of $634.59 billion as of January 3. RBI data showed that theforex kittydeclined by $5.7 billion in the reported week after falling by a cumulative $17.8 billion in the previous three weeks. Forex reserves have fallen by about $70 billion from their all-time high of $704.89 billion in late September 2024. The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.39% to 109.70. It reached as high as 109.97, its highest level since November 2022, Reuters reported. The yield on benchmark US 10-year notes rose 8 basis points to 4.761%. It had reached as high as 4.79%, its highest level since November 2023. Crude oil prices hit the highest in more than four months after fresh US sanctions against Russia’s energy industry. Brent crude oil rallied 2.14% to $81.47 a barrel, after surging almost 4% in the previous session, while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures surged 2.26% to $78.30.

    "body": "13/01/25 | 4:55 pm | Nifty-Sensex Share Indian Stock Market Plunges Over 1% Amid Mixed Cues The Indian stock market witnessed a sharp downturn on Monday, with both the Sensex and Nifty indexes plummeting over 1% amid a mix of global and domestic pressures. Strong employment data from the United States suggested fewer rate cuts in 2025, adding to concerns about tighter monetary policies. Adding to the challenges, rising crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, and significant foreign capital outflows further dampened investor sentiment. The market sell-off resulted in a staggering loss of approximately ₹12 lakh crore for investors. The Sensex closed at 76,330.01, falling by 1,048.90 points, or 1.36%, while the Nifty ended at 23,085.95, marking a decline of 345.55 points, or 1.47%. Heavy selling pressure was observed across sectors, particularly in real estate, public sector banks, metals, auto, and pharma. Realty stocks took a significant hit, with the sector declining over 6%. Market experts attributed the decline to a ripple effect from global markets, which faced a broad sell-off. The robust US payroll data fueled concerns about prolonged monetary tightening, strengthening the dollar, raising bond yields, and reducing the appeal of emerging markets. Rupak De of LKP Securities noted the growing bearish sentiment, saying, “Bears remained at the helm as the Nifty continued to breach crucial levels. The index slipped below its previous swing low on the daily chart, indicating increasing bearishness. However, it held the 23,000 mark, which remains a key level to watch. If the Nifty sustains above 23,000 over the next few days, it could signal a potential recovery. Conversely, a decisive fall below this level might trigger a deeper correction.” Among the broader indices, the Nifty Bank fell by 692.90 points, or 1.42%, to settle at 48,041.25. The Nifty Midcap 100 plunged 2,195.35 points, or 4.02%, closing at 52,390.4. Meanwhile, the Nifty Smallcap 100 dropped 723.45 points, or 4.10%, to end at 16,922.10. In terms of individual performances, companies like Zomato, Power Grid, Tata Steel, NTPC, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra, and Sun Pharma were among the major losers in the Sensex pack. However, a few stocks, including Axis Bank, TCS, IndusInd Bank, and Hindustan Unilever Limited, bucked the trend to emerge as the top gainers. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling streak for the sixth consecutive trading day, offloading equities worth ₹2,254.68 crore on January 10. In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹3,961.92 crore, offering some respite to the market. The mixed cues, coupled with escalating challenges from both global and domestic factors, signal continued volatility in the near term, with market participants closely watching the 23,000 level on the Nifty for further direction. – IANS",

    "title": "Indian stock market falls in 6 of 9 sessions in January: How should you rejig your portfolio now?",
    "body": "After delivering moderate returns in 2024,Indian marketshave lost 2.3 per cent in January 2025 so far. Today is the fourth straight day of losses for the benchmarks that have fallen in six out of the nine trading sessions so far in January. The losses come amid rising crude oil prices, weakening rupee and massive foreign capital outflows. Sensexfell 1,129 points to the day's low of 76,249.72 whileNiftylost 331 points to hit an intra-day low of 23,100.60. The selloff was sharper in the mid and small-cap segments, a trend that has been observed in 2025 so far. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 4 per cent each. \"Market will continue to be under pressure from the many strong headwinds. The blowout jobs data from the US with 2.56 lakh job creations in December against expectations of 1.65 lakhs means the rate cut expectations in 2025 are now down to one. With the unemployment in the US down to 4.1% the economy doesn’t need any stimulus. This good economic news is turning out to be bad news for markets which were discounting many rate cuts this year. For India, the Brent crude rising to $81 is a concern. But the IIP data for November at 5.2 per cent indicates that the economy is recovering from the slowdown in Q2,\" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “With the US 10-year bond yield above 4.7 per cent, FIIs will continue to sell offering opportunities for long-term investors to buy reasonably priced large-caps. The broader market will continue to be under pressure,” he added. Amid the current bloodbath on Dalal Street, the big question remains: How should investors rejig their portfolios to safeguard against sharp market drawdowns? The consensus among experts is clear: 2025 demands a balanced and diversified portfolio to navigate the challenges ahead. With evolving macroeconomic conditions, experts advise investors to focus on risk management, maintain flexibility in their strategies, and align their investments with growth-oriented and resilient sectors. Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research, SAMCO Securities observed that while returns appeared decent in absolute terms in 2024, the relative performance—adjusted for volatility—was less attractive for many investor classes. For 2025, Sheth emphasised an investment strategy prioritising capital preservation over aggressive returns. He recommended a balanced portfolio allocation: 50% in large-cap stocks, focusing on private banks, pharmaceuticals, and IT; 25% in debt instruments; and 25% in gold. Trivesh D, COO at Tradejini, also suggested maintaining a diversified portfolio across equities, gold, and fixed-income instruments. This approach minimises risk and enhances return potential, he said. He further noted that high-PE-ratio stocks could be vulnerable to short-term corrections. Trivesh advised booking profits in overvalued segments and holding cash to seize future opportunities in undervalued or growth-oriented sectors. Divam Sharma, Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio PMS, stressed the need for investors to recalibrate their approach in light of uncertainties arising from global economic pressures, government policy shifts, and technological advancements. He highlighted India’s economic resilience, driven by factors such as digital transformation, infrastructure growth, and an expanding middle class. “While large-cap stocks could face global headwinds, mid-cap and small-cap companies in innovative sectors are expected to outperform in 2025,” Sharma said. Making a similar case for investments in mid and small-cap stocks, Anil Rego, Founder and Fund Manager, Right Horizons PMS advised increasing exposure to high-conviction ideas within the small and mid-cap stocks segment, especially in themes with favourable earnings growth outlooks, while being mindful of mounting geopolitical risks and expensive valuations. Rego highlighted that the equity rally over FY20-FY24 was driven by strong corporateearnings, domestic inflows, and a resilient macroeconomic environment. However, entering 2025, corporate earnings growth is expected to moderate due to commodity pressures and diminishing tailwinds. He provided a nuanced market outlook, citing - 1) Fair valuations in large-cap stocks, 2) Stretched valuations in broader markets, and 3) Reasonable valuations in select high-quality small and mid-cap stocks with strong growth potential.

Here are five reasons why Indian Markets are falling today. On the very first day in office, Trump made several announcements, including tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Trump has threatened higher tariffs on several countries, including India. His immigration policies could also impact the Indian tech sector. Investors are now focused on this mega-policy event. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Budget on Saturday, 1 February. Expectations are high that the government will announce measures to boost consumption, strengthen the rural sector, and support manufacturing and infrastructure, all while maintaining fiscal prudence. A relentless selloff by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) amid the strengthening US dollar and rising bond yields is a key factor behind the Indian stock market's downtrend in recent months. Except for 2 January, FPIs have been selling Indian equities every day in January, offloading nearly Rs 510 bn as of 2 January. After weak Q1 and Q2 earnings, the December quarter earnings so far have also been unimpressive, exhibiting mixed trends across sectors. The Indian economy is showing signs of weakness, which has contributed to the cautious sentiment in the market. Speaking of stock markets, research analyst, Tanushree Banerjee highlights that public sector banks are not alien to the concepts of loan write-offs and government bailouts. Time and again the entities have resorted to these. Rather, whenever the credit cycle tightens and non-performing loans (NPAs) spike, the government gets generous about bailing out the big banks. So, the vicious cycle makes a comeback every few years. Will it be different this time? In news from the defence sector,shares of Hindustan Aeronauticsare sharply lower by more than 2% in trade on 21 January, after an unconfirmed report by a defence news website cited a rock block to HAL's deal with General Electric for the F-414 engine, meant for India's Light Combat Aircraft Tejas. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited the US in August last year to strengthen and widen defence cooperation, amid issues around timely delivery of GE's F-404 engines. The delays had reportedly been attributed to supply chain disruptions at GE Aerospace back then. Even in the past, there have been unconfirmed reports over delays in the supply of GE engines, threatening to have a cascading effect on the induction of HAL's Light Combat Aircraft Tejas Mk-1A into the Indian Air Force. The timeline of LCA's induction has been revised more than once since the original schedule was announced. Moving on to news from the realty sector,shares of Sunteck Realtyskyrocketed over 10% on 21 January, buoyed by the company's solid earnings performance in the December quarter. The real estate major jumped back into the black with a net profit of Rs 425 million (m), a massive turnaround from a loss of Rs 97 m in the year-ago period. The surge in net profit was also coupled with an over 2.5x jump in revenue to Rs 1,618 m, up from Rs 424 m in the same quarter last fiscal. The operational performance also remained strong, with an EBITDA margin of 29.9%. The company's presales of Rs 635 crore in Q3, up 40% on the year. The growth was driven by the 66% contribution from Uber luxury and the 19% contribution from the premium luxury segments. Sunteck Realty also added the Nepean Sea project-2 with a total gross development value of Rs 24 bn. Shares of the real estate developer have been on a downtrend for the past three months, losing nearly 12% of its value as investors jumped on a profit-booking spree. Moving on, gold prices rose for a second session on Tuesday as the dollar weakened, with markets evaluating the possible consequences of US President Donald Trump's policies in his second term after his inauguration. Spot gold gained 0.6% to US$ 2,724.74 per ounce by 0240 GMT. US gold futures were 0.2% lower at US$ 2,742.50. The dollar was down about 1% after reports suggested any new taxes would be imposed in a \"measured\" way. A weaker dollar makes gold more attractive to foreign buyers. After weeks of global speculation over which duties Trump would impose tariffs on his first day in office, news that Trump would take more time on tariffs drove a relief rally in global stocks and pressured the US dollar. Trump had proposed tariffs of up to 10% on global imports, 60% on Chinese goods, and a 25% import surcharge on Canadian and Mexican products.

    "title": "Explained: How Union Budget Influences Stock Market",
    "body": "This Article is From Jan 20, 2025 Explained: How Union Budget Influences Stock Market The stock market usually reacts positively when the Budget includes measures aimed at boosting the economy. Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email With Union Budget presentation on February 1, the stock markets are set to remain open on Saturday. The Union Budget is one of the most anticipated events in the economic calendar, often leading to significant fluctuations in the stock market. Investors, businesses, and analysts closely scrutinise the Budget proposals to gauge how government policies will affect different sectors of the economy. This year, with Nirmala Sitharaman presenting her eighth consecutive Budget on February 1, the stock markets are set to remain open on Saturday, which is a rare occurrence as markets are typically closed on weekends. As Budget Day approaches, let's explore how it influences the stock market. One of the key expectations from the Budget is that it promotes economic growth. The stock market usually reacts positively when the Budget includes measures aimed at boosting the economy. This could include new initiatives like tax cuts, investments in infrastructure, or incentives for businesses. When the government introduces such reforms, it boosts investor confidence, leading to a rise in stock prices. Putting More Money In People's Hands The stock market also reacts well to measures that increase the amount of money people have to spend. These include tax reductions, direct income transfers, and efforts to control inflation. When people have more disposable income, they spend more, helping businesses grow. Sectors like retail, automobiles, and consumer goods often benefit from such changes, and as a result, their stock prices rise. Changes In Taxation The Budget often introduces changes in taxes, which can have a big effect on the stock market. On one hand, tax cuts for both individuals and businesses increase disposable income and corporate profits. This can encourage more investments and boost stock prices. On the other hand, if taxes are increased, it could lower spending and affect the market negatively. The Budget also affects taxes on profits made from selling stocks or dividends received from companies. Lower taxes on these profits can encourage people to invest more in the stock market, leading to higher stock prices. However, higher taxes on capital gains and dividends could discourage investment, which would negatively affect the stock market. Mutual Funds And Bonds The Budget impacts the market for mutual funds and bonds as well. The government may announce measures that make investing in mutual funds more attractive or change the taxation on bonds. For example, including Indian government bonds in global investment indexes can attract more foreign money, which helps the stock market grow. Fiscal Deficit The fiscal deficit refers to the gap between the government's income and expenditure. A high fiscal deficit usually means the government needs to borrow more money, which can increase inflation and interest rates, affecting businesses negatively. Conversely, a lower fiscal deficit is seen as a sign of sound financial management, which can positively impact the stock market. Previous Budgets Add NDTV As A Trusted Source In the past, certain Budgets have had a big impact on the stock market. For example, in 1991, India's economy was liberalised under the leadership of then-Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, and this Budget set the stage for huge market growth in the following years. Similarly, the 1997 Budget by P Chidambaram, which reduced taxes, was also well-received by the stock market.

    "title": "What does Donald Trump's second term mean for Indian stock market? EXPLAINED with five crucial points",
    "body": "Trump 2.0:After the stock market crash ahead ofDonald Trump's swearing-in date, Dalal Street and other bourses of the global markets would be anxiously waiting for the economic outlook that the new administration unveils post-inauguration of the 47th US President. Investors would be keen to know the tariff policy of Donald Trump's administration and the road map to contain geopolitical tension, especially in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East region. However,Donald Trump's policyonUS inflationand the uncertainties around the US economy will also be a significant attraction after his re-entry to the White House. According to stock market experts, the market believes the Donald Trump administration will prioritize American interests with tariffs and trade agreements. This may challenge countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand might benefit if Donald Trump prioritizes these US interests. However, this protectionist policy of the Trump 2.0 administration may dent Asian countries' green initiatives. They said that Trump 2.0 is expected to boost defence tech companies, but export-oriented companies may face challenges caused by the expected tariff war. Here we list out the top five crucial points that investors of the Indian stock market may like to know ahead of Donald Trump's swearing-in date: 1] Dent to green stocks:\"Due to the expected escalation in the tariff war, if Donald Trump sticks with his protectionist policy, Asia's energy transition to renewables could be complicated by Trump's fossil fuel-friendly stance, which may temporarily benefit US-based oil companies like Exxon Mobil but hinder broader green energy efforts,\" said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets. So, India's solar and other green energy stocks are expected to come under pressure next week. 2] Advantage for defence stocks:\"Asia's economies may face volatility due to Trump's trade wars and tariffs, but some sectors—like tech and defence could thrive. So, Trump 2.0 is expected to fuel buying in defence and tech-enabled defence stocks in the near term,\" said Ross Maxwell of VT Markets. Speaking on the advantages for Indian defence companies, Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment and Securities, said, \"Rather than looking at traditional defence stocks, one should look at buying tech-enabled defence stocks like drone and aerospace stocks.\" 3] Pressure for export-oriented companies:Expecting pressure for export-oriented segments, Anshul Jain said, \"Donald Trump's protectionist tariff policy is expected to pose a challenge for export-oriented segments like textile, IT, etc. However, one should avoid taking any fresh position in large-cap IT and other export-oriented companies.\" 4] Advantage for fintech stocks:\"Donald Trump's stricter immigration policy may lead to more tech talent staying in Asia, boosting regional innovation hubs in countries like India, Singapore, and South Korea. This shift may also benefit fintech companies,\" said Ross Maxwell of VT Markets. So, one is advised to remain vigilant about the fintech stocks when the market re-opens on Monday next week. 5] Advantages for infra rail stocks:\"In the wake of Donald Trump's decoupling with China, companies will likely shift from China to India, Vietnam and Indonesia. India could see accelerated growth as a growing manufacturing hub if trade barriers with China persist. So, this will likely create demand for infrastructure, transportation, and logistics, especially rail logistics. So, infra and railway stocks are expected to remain under the bulls' radar in the near term,\" said Anhsul Jain of Lakshmishree Investment and Securities.

    "title": "Stock market today: Nifty 50, Sensex extend gains to 2nd day, led by IT and cement stocks; broader market rebounds",
    "body": "Indian Stock Market: Dalal Street witnessed another day of gains on Thursday, January 23, as strong support from IT and cement stocks helped frontline indices remain in positive territory for the second consecutive session. Notably, the broader market staged a sharp recovery after facing selling pressure in recent sessions. The Nifty 50 ended 53.50 points higher, or with a 0.22% gain, at 23,205, while the BSE Sensex finished the trade at 76,512, up 0.14%, or 107 points, than Wednesday's close. The Nifty Midcap 100 index jumped 1.86% to 54,098, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended the session with a gain of 1.12% at the 17,364 level. IT stocks continued their strong performance for the second day, with mid- and small-cap stocks outperforming. Stocks such as Coforge, Persistent Systems, and Zensar Technologies recorded gains of up to 11%, driven by impressive Q3FY25 results. Similarly,better-than-expected results from Ultratech Cementlifted sentiment across the cement sector, leading to strong gains in major counters. Shares of Ultratech Cement soared nearly 7%, while those of Kesoram Industries, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Cement and Grasim Industries all ended the session with gains of up to 5%. Meanwhile, EMS stocks like Amber Enterprises, Dixon Technologies, and Kaynes Technology rebounded in trade after recent valuation concerns had kept them under pressure. New-age tech stocks, including PB Fintech, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, and CarTrade Tech, saw healthy buying interest during the session, although they remain up to 30% below their recent peaks. The recent entrant on the exchanges, Go Digit General Insurance saw its shares jump 15% to₹327 apiece after the company reported a nearly three-fold rise in its net profit to₹119 crore in Q3FY25. Commenting on today's market performance, Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities, said, \"Markets were range-bound with a mixed bias intra-day and ended slightly higher as investors resorted to select buying in the beaten-down IT, telecom, and realty shares.\" \"Thesharp fall in rupee against the dollar, which has been fueling foreign fund outflows over the past few months, is making investors jittery. With the ongoing corporate earnings outcome not so encouraging so far and Budget round the corner, investors will play safe bets with a selective buying approach and mostly at global markets for cues,\" he added. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said “Uncertainty lingers whether the trade tariff measures will affect global trade, instigate higher inflation, and currencies volatility. The trend holds a declining momentum YTD with a pause today contemplating the upcoming 2025 budget, which has a muted expectation. Meanwhile in-line Q3 results showcasing QoQ growth to the indices suggesting that Q4 will be much better.” Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"Following a positive start, the trading session on Thursday remained muted, with the index showing limited movement. It failed to break above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart, indicating selling pressure at higher levels. The bearish trend is likely to persist as long as the index stays below 23,400. On the downside, support levels are observed at 23,150 and 23,000.\" Disclaimer:The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

Asian markets gained, while the US stock market ended higher overnight amid a rebound rally led by technology stocks.

Investors remain cautious due to growing global uncertainty and disappointing domestic economic indicators. However, optimism in banking, auto and realty aided sentiment even as worries over Trump’s trade policies and fading chances of any rate cut in next month’s credit policy weighed,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded higher Wednesday tracking overnight rebound on Wall Street, while several markets in the region were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.62%, while the Topix rose 0.39%. Gift Nifty was trading around 23,028 level, a premium of nearly 50 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a positive start for the Indian stock market indices.

TheDow Jones Industrial Averagegained 136.77 points, or 0.31%, to 44,850.35, while the S&P 500 rallied 55.42 points, or 0.92%, to 6,067.70.

Royal Caribbean shares rallied 12%, Boeing stock advanced 1.5%, and General Motors share price dropped 8.9%. US consumer confidence weakened for a second straight month in January amid renewed concerns about the labor market and inflation. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 104.1 this month from an upwardly revised 109.5 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 105.6 from the previously reported 104.7. New orders for key US-manufactured capital goods increased more than expected in December. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% after an upwardly revised 0.9% gain in November, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders climbing 0.3% after a previously reported 0.4% rise in November.

    "body": "Indian stock market: The equity market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open higher on Monday, despite mixed global market cues. Asian markets traded mixed, while the US stock market ended higher last week, after inflation data. This week, investors will focus on keystock market triggers, including the RBI monetary policy, India-US trade deal, developments over US tariffs, domestic and global macroeconomic data, flow of foreign funds, trends in gold prices, and other key geopolitical developments. On Friday, the Indian stock market sharply ended lower, extending its losing streak for the sixth straight session, as fresh Trump tariffs on pharmaceuticals and persistent foreign fund outflow weighed on market sentiment. TheSensexdeclined 733.22 points, or 0.90%, to close at 80,426.46, while the Nifty 50 settled 236.15 points, or 0.95%, lower at 24,654.70. “We expect markets to remain under pressure in the near term, tracking global headwinds, key macroeconomic data, and potential development around the India–US trade talks,” said Siddhartha Khemka - Head of Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asia markets traded mixed on Monday as investors braced for a possible shutdown of the US government. Japan’sNikkei 225fell 0.68%, and the Topix declined 1.27%. South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.05% and the Kosdaq rose 0.82%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures indicated a higher opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 24,810 level, a premium of nearly 120 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a gap-up start for the Indian stock market indices. US stock market ended higher on Friday after mostly in-line US inflation data, but the three major indexes posted losses for the week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq snapping three-week streaks of weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 299.97 points, or 0.65%, to 46,247.29, while the S&P 500 rallied 38.98 points, or 0.59%, to 6,643.70. The Nasdaq Composite closed 99.37 points, or 0.44%, higher at 22,484.07. For the week, theDow Jonesfell 0.2%, the S&P 500 declined 0.3% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.7%. Nvidia share price gained 0.28, Apple shares fell 0.55%, Tesla stock price rallied 4.02%, while Eli Lilly rose 1.4%. Costco Wholesale shares fell 2.9% and Electronic Arts shares jumped 14.9%. Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine early on Sunday, killing at least four people and injuring dozens, in one of the most sustained attacks on the capital since the full-scale war began. Russia’s defence ministry said it had carried out a ‘massive’ attack on Ukraine using long-range air- and sea-based weapons and drones to target military infrastructure, including airfields. The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure edged up in August. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index increased 0.3% in August after gaining 0.2% in July. In the 12 months through August, the PCE Price Index advanced 2.7%. That was the biggest year-on-year increase since February and followed a 2.6% rise in July. US consumer spending increased slightly more than expected in August. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.5% advance in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5%. US government shutdown date is approaching fast. President Donald Trump will meet with the top Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress to discuss extending government funding. The last date for the government funding is September 30. Without a deal a shutdown would begin from October 1, which is also when new US tariffs on heavy trucks, pharmaceuticals and other items go into effect. The US dollar was on the defensive ahead of a slew of economic data releases. The US dollar index was steady at 98.134. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.2% to 149.24, after having risen over 1% against the Japanese currency last week, Reuters reported. The euro rose 0.15% to $1.1717, while sterling edged 0.11% higher to $1.3418. Gold prices traded higher after notching a sixth weekly gain as traders weighed a potential US government shutdown. Gold price traded near $3,773 an ounce after gaining 2% last week. Crude oil prices fell nearly 1% after Iraq’s Kurdistan region resumed crude oil exports via Turkey over the weekend and as OPEC plans another oil output hike in November. Brent crude futures fell 0.99% to $69.46 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude declined 1% to $65.06 a barrel.

    "body": "Indian stock market: The equity market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open on a flat note Tuesday, following mixed global market cues. Asian markets traded mixed, while the US stock market ended higher overnight, led by a rally in technology stocks. On Monday, the Indian stock market ended lower, extending its losing streak to the seventh consecutive session. TheSensexdeclined 61.52 points, or 0.08%, to close at 80,364.94, while the Nifty 50 settled 19.80 points, or 0.08%, lower at 24,634.90. “On one hand, the overhang of recent US policy actions has eased slightly; however, persistent foreign fund outflows and caution ahead of the MPC meeting continue to weigh on sentiment. Participants should focus on selective stock opportunities aligned with sectoral trends while keeping position sizes under check,” said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded mixed on Tuesday, following overnight gains on Wall Street. Japan’sNikkei 225fell 0.32%, while the Topix declined 0.21%. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.27%, while the Kosdaq rose 0.18%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures indicated a higher opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 24,692 level, a premium of nearly 7 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a flat start for the Indian stock market indices. US stock market ended higher on Monday, led by gains in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 68.78 points, or 0.15%, to 46,316.07, while the S&P 500 rose 17.51 points, or 0.26%, to 6,661.21. The Nasdaq Composite closed 107.09 points, or 0.48%, higher at 22,591.15. Nvidia share price rallied 2.07%, Amazon shares gained 1.09%, Intel stock dipped 2.9%, while Tesla stock price rose 0.64%. Electronic Arts shares surged 4.5%, Lam Research shares advanced 2.15%, Canopy Growth share price jumped 17% while Cronos Group shares spiked 13.15% and Tilray Brands shares jumped 60.9%. US President Donald Trump set a 10% tariff rate on imports of lumber and 25% on vanities, kitchen cabinets and upholstered wooden products. The tariffs will take effect on October 14. On January 1, the tariff rates would increase to 30% for upholstered wooden products and to 50% for kitchen cabinets and vanities imported from countries that fail to reach an agreement with the US. US Vice President JD Vance said he believes the US government is on track to shut down. “I think we're headed to a shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said. President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents appeared to make little progress at a White House meeting aimed at heading off a government shutdown. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem said he was open to further interest rate cuts but the Fed must be cautious and keep rates high enough to continue to lean against inflation that remains roughly a percentage point above the central bank’s 2% target, Reuters reported. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that emerging signs of weakness in the labor market drove his support for cutting interest rates at the most recent central bank meeting. China’s manufacturing activity shrank for a sixth month in September. The official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 49.8 in September versus 49.4 in August, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, and beating a median forecast of 49.6 in a Reuters poll. Bank of Japan board members debated the feasibility of raising interest rates in the near term, with one suggesting the timing may be appropriate, a summary of opinions at the central bank’s September policy meeting showed. Crude oil prices fell on another anticipated production increase by OPEC and the resumption of oil exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan region via Turkey. Brent crude futures for November delivery fell 0.66% to $67.52 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude price was trading at $63.07 a barrel, down 0.60%. The US dollar fell in cautious trading as investors braced for a possible US government shutdown. US dollar index, which has dropped 9.7% this year, eased a bit to 97.948. The euro was flat at $1.17275, while sterling was at $1.3433. The Japanese yen was slightly weaker at 148.72 per US dollar.

    "title": "Sensex falls 400 points, investors lose  ₹3 lakh crore in a day— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Stock market today: The Indian stock market ended with significant losses on Wednesday, September 24, tracking weak global cues. The Sensex closed the day at 81,715.63, down 386 points, or 0.47 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 25,056.90, down 113 points, or 0.45 per cent. Thus, the benchmarks extended their losing run to the fourth consecutive session. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.85 per cent and 0.50 per cent, respectively. Investors lost nearly₹3 lakh crore in a single session as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to nearly₹460.5 lakh crore from₹463.6 lakh crore in the previous session. Weak global cues, the dollar's rise, and persisting concerns over valuations, FII selling and Trump's tariffs kept the market down for the fourth consecutive session. Major European markets, including the UK's FTSE, France's CAC 40, and Germany's DAX, traded in the red when the Sensex ended amid a rise in the US dollar after theUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell'smixed signals on rate cuts on Tuesday. In his speech on Tuesday, 23 September, Powell said that if the Fed cuts its rates too fast, it will leave the task of containing inflation unfinished to bring it under the central bank's target range. With optimism over GST cuts behind, investors have shifted their focus back to valuations, earnings, and tariff chatter following the H-1B visa fee hike. \"Profit booking has been observed in Indian markets post-GST reforms, as investors recalibrate valuations and Q2 earnings expectations. IT stocks underperformed due to H-1B fee hikes, while US trade rhetoric amid ongoing trade negotiations and weak global cues are prompting cautious investor sentiment,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. \"India’s relatively high valuations, coupled with moderation in earnings growth, continue to lead FIIs to trim their positions. That said, structural reforms and domestic growth drivers are keeping the underlying trend constructive. Current headwinds appear transitory, with headwinds likely to ease over time,\" Nair said. As many as 34 stocks ended in the red in the Nifty 50 index. Shares of Tata Motors (down 2.62 per cent), BEL (down 2.16 per cent), and Jio Financial Services (down 2.02 per cent) ended as the top losers. Shares of Power Grid Corporation (up 1.68 per cent), HUL (up 1.36 per cent), and NTPC (up 1.31 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Barring Nifty FMCG (up 0.18 per cent), all sectoral indices ended with losses, with Nifty Realty (down 2.49 per cent) ending as the top loser. Nifty Auto (down 1.15 per cent), Private Bank (down 0.86 per cent), Media (down 0.81 per cent), and IT (down 0.72 per cent) ended with significant losses. Nifty Bank fell 0.70 per cent, while the Financial Services index declined 0.64 per cent. Vodafone Idea (66.84 crore shares), Adani Power (13.60 crore shares), and YES Bank (7.7 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Zuari Industries, Raj Packaging Industries, NACDAC Infrastructure, Machino Plastics, Ishaan Infrastructures and Shelters, Sacheta Metals, Universal Arts, and Incap were the eight stocks that jumped over 15 per cent on the BSE, defying weak market sentiment. On the other hand, Adani Power, Diggi Multitrade, Eimco Elecon (India), and PDP Shipping & Projects were the four stocks that crashed over 10 per cent on the BSE. Out of 4,320 stocks traded on the BSE, 1,602 advanced, while 2,565 declined. Some 153 stocks remained unchanged. As many as 176 stocks, including Maruti Suzuki India, SBI, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, and Canara Bank, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. SpiceJet, Symphony, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Quess Corp, Praj Industries, Ganesha Ecosphere, and Aurionpro Solutions were among the 76 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, on intraday charts, the Nifty 50 is holding a lower top formation, and on daily charts, it formed a bearish candle, which is largely negative. \"We are of the view that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 25,000 level. Below this, the market could slip to 24,900–24,810. On the flip side, above 25,100, the pullback move could extend up to 25,200-25250. The intraday market texture is volatile; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders,\" said Chouhan. Nilesh Jain, the head technical and derivatives research analyst at Centrum Broking, said the Nifty 50 has now completed a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 24,404 to the recent peak of 25,448, with the key level around 25,050. \"A decisive move below this level could open the door for further downside towards 24,920, which coincides with the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as the 50 per cent retracement of the recent uptrend,\" said Jain. \"Despite the ongoing weakness, the broader structure remains positive as long as Nifty holds above 24,900. On the upside, a breakout above 25,150 would invalidate the current bearish setup and may trigger a short-covering rally towards 25,300,\" Jain said.

    "body": "Indian stock market: The equity benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open lower on Thursday, following weak global market cues. Asian markets traded mixed, while the US stock market ended lower overnight, extending its fall for the second straight session. On Wednesday, the Indian stock market ended lower, extending losses for the fourth consecutive session, amid selling across the board. TheSensexdeclined 386.47 points, or 0.47%, to close at 81,715.63, while the Nifty 50 settled 112.60 points, or 0.45%, lower at 25,056.90. “Overall, while festive demand and GST-led structural reforms provide support, currency weakness and global headwinds including uncertainty related to India-US trade deal are likely to keep markets range-bound in the near term,” said Siddhartha Khemka - Head of Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded mixed on Thursday, following overnight losses on Wall Street. Japan’sNikkei 225fell 0.11%, while the Topix gained 0.18%. South Korea’s Kospi eased 0.02%, and the Kosdaq dropped 0.27%. Hong Kong Hang Seng index futures indicated a lower opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 25,065 level, a discount of nearly 47 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a negative start for the Indian stock market indices. US stock market indices ended lower for a second straight session on Wednesday, as investors booked profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 171.50 points, or 0.37%, to 46,121.28, while the S&P 500 fell 18.94 points, or 0.28%, to 6,637.98.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which make up about 14% of US home sales, easing to a rate of 650,000 units. The goods and services tax (GST) reforms should help lower retail prices and support consumption growth, the Reserve Bank of India said in its monthly bulletin. The GST reforms should “progressively result in a sustained positive impact through significant gains in ease of doing business, lower retail prices and strengthening of consumption growth drivers”, the bulletin said. Higher seasonal agricultural sowing is also expected to keep food prices in check, it said. Gold prices rebounded, driven by expectations of further US interest rate cuts, geopolitical risks, and a slightly weaker dollar. Spot gold price rose 0.3% to $3,747.59 per ounce, while US gold futures for December delivery gained 0.3% to $3,778.50. The US dollar was steady, holding its overnight gains. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six other units, was at 97.813, hovering near a three-week high. The euro was steady at $1.17425, while Sterling was little changed at $1.3451. The yen was last at 148.62 per US dollar. Crude oil prices fell as investors booked profits after a jump to a seven-week high during the prior session. Brent crude futures fell 0.03% to $69.29 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 0.15% to $64.89 a barrel. Both benchmarks gained 2.5% in the previous session.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty 50 extend losses to 7th consecutive session— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Stock market today:Indian stock market benchmarks—the Sensex and the Nifty 50—ended in negative territory on Monday, September 29, extending their losing streak to the seventh consecutive session. In these seven sessions, both indices have declined by over 3 per cent each. The Sensex ended 62 points, or 0.08 per cent, lower at 80,364.94, while the Nifty 50 settled at 24,634.90, down 20 points, or 0.08 per cent on Monday. The BSE Midcap index outperformed, rising 0.34 per cent, but the Smallcap index slipped 0.17 per cent. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and Bharti Airtel were the top drags on the Sensex, while HDFC Bank and SBI offered the strongest support to the index. The Indian stock market's fall over the last seven sessions could be largely attributed to US President Donald Trump's fresh protectionist measures—an H-1B visa fee hike and a tariff on pharma imports. Relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and the lack of fresh positive triggers are also affecting market sentiment. \"The domestic market concluded a volatile session on a flat note as investors turned more cautious ahead of a holiday-led truncated week and continued FII selling. Lack of clarity in the US-India trade deal and prolonged pressure on IT and pharma indices are near-term concerns for the market,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. Nair observed that investors await the RBI policy outcome on Wednesday, and the central bank is expected to keep the rates unchanged to contain volatility in the rupee. Shares of Maruti Suzuki India (down 1.76 per cent), Axis Bank (down 1.73 per cent), and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (down 1.13 per cent) ended as the top losers. Shares of IndusInd Bank (up 3.07 per cent), Titan Company (up 2.70 per cent), and Hindalco Industries (up 1.65 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Nifty PSU Bank ended with a stellar gain of 1.78 per cent, followed by Nifty Oil and Gas, which rose 1.35 per cent and Nifty Realty, which gained 0.88 per cent. The Nifty Bank index climbed 0.13 per cent. Vodafone Idea (73.91 crore shares), Sammaan Capital (15.67 crore shares), and PC Jeweller (6.97 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Bazel International, Graviss Hospitality, Natura Hue Chem, Vascon Engineers, and Sacheta Metals were among the 10 stocks that jumped over 10 per cent on the BSE. Out of 4,377 stocks traded on the BSE, 1,919 advanced, while 2,275 declined. Some 183 stocks remained unchanged. As many as 146 stocks, including Usha Martin, Tata Investment Corporation, Supreme Petrochem, RBL Bank, Minda Corporation, and Indian Bank, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. Five-Star Business Finance, Vedant Fashions, Praj Industries, and Ramkrishna Forgings were among the 166 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, the Nifty formed a bearish candle on daily charts, and on intraday charts, it continues to show a lower top formation, which is largely negative. Chouhan believes that the short-term market outlook is weak, but since it is oversold, a quick pullback rally is a strong possibility. \"For day traders, 24,800 would act as an immediate resistance zone. If the market successfully clears this level, it could bounce back up to 24,900-24,925. On the other side, below 24,600, the selling pressure is likely to accelerate. Below this level, it could retest the levels of 24,500–24,450,\" said Chouhan. Ajit Mishra, SVP of research at Religare Broking, believes oversold positions may now lead to some consolidation in the Nifty. Strong support is around the 24,400–24,500 zone, and resistance is placed at 24,800–25,000.

The Sensex closed the day at 81,159.68, down 555.95 points, or 0.68 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 24,890.85, down 166.05 points, or 0.66 per cent. Broader markets were also down. Nifty MidCap 100 index slipped 0.64 per cent, while Nifty SmallCap 100 index was down 0.57 per cent. Investors lost nearly₹3 lakh crore in a single session as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to nearly₹457.4 lakh crore from₹460.5 lakh crore in the previous session. Weak global cues, the dollar's rise, and persisting concerns over valuations, FII selling and Trump's tariffs kept the market down for the fifth consecutive session. \"Indian markets extended its losing streak for a fifth straight session as investors booked profits amid persistent FII outflows and uncertainty over US-India trade talks, which is expected to dent Q2 GDP growth. Broad based selling prevailed in the market with heavy selling across auto, IT, pharma, and healthcare sectors, while metals gained on the back of China’s liquidity support and copper supply concerns. Overall, sentiment remains cautious ahead of India’s H2FY26 borrowing and US macroeconomic data, expected to be released over the end of the week,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. As many as 43 stocks ended in the red in the Nifty 50 index. Shares of Trent (down 3.61 per cent), PowerGrid (down 3.10 per cent), and Tata Motors (down 2.64 per cent) ended as the top losers. Shares of BEL (up 2.07 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (up 1.51 per cent), and Hindalco (up 0.80 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index.

Vedant Fashions, TCS, Route Mobile, Praj Industries and United Breweries were among the 77 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. \"The Nifty has fallen below the crucial support level of 25,050, which also coincides with the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the previous rise from 24,400 to 25,450. Additionally, the index has slipped below the 21 EMA on the daily timeframe, confirming increasing bearish sentiment. It appears that the bulls are stepping back, giving bears more control over the market. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 24,800; a break below this level could trigger a deeper and more serious correction. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,000,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.

    "body": "Stock market today:The Indian stock market ended lower on Tuesday, September 23, with frontline indices, the Sensex and the Nifty 50, extending losses to their third consecutive session as concerns over an H-1B visa fee hike and uncertainty over India-US trade talks continued weighing on sentiment. However, expectations of favourable growth-inflation dynamics amid GST reforms, a normal monsoon, and interest rate cuts limited losses for the markets. The Sensex closed at 82,102.10, down 58 points, or 0.07 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 25,169.50, down 33 points, or 0.13 per cent. The mid and small-cap segments underperformed as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.29 per cent and 0.35 per cent, respectively. The overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms stood at below₹464 lakh crore from slightly over₹465 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors poorer by over₹1 lakh crore in a single session. Domestic market sentiment has turned weak due to lingering uncertainty over the India-US trade talks. While both nations remain engaged in reaching a deal, US President Donald Trump's surprise H-1B visa fee hike has raised concerns that a collapse of trade talks could result in more aggressive similar moves from the US administration. \"The Indian stock market witnessed a highly volatile session on Tuesday as a steep hike in H-1B visa fees kept investor sentiment cautious, prompting a flat-to-weak opening. Nifty initially faced selling pressure from the 25,250 zone and slipped to an intraday low of 25,100, where it found strong support. From there, the index staged a sharp recovery to touch the day’s high, reflecting strong buying interest at lower levels,\" Ashika Institutional Equities observed. As many as 31 stocks ended in the red in the Nifty 50 index, Tech Mahindra (down 2.16 per cent), Trent (down 2.11 per cent), and SBI Life Insurance Company (down 2 per cent) being the top losers. Shares of IndusInd Bank (up 2.82 per cent), Axis Bank (up 2.24 per cent), and Bajaj Finance (up 1.93 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Nifty FMCG, Realty, and IT indices ended as the top losers, falling up to a per cent. On the other hand, Nifty PSU Bank and Metal indices rose by a per cent each. Nifty Bank index rose by 0.41 per cent, while the Financial Services index ended 0.12 per cent higher. \"Sector-wise, autos, metals, and financials gained on signs of robust festive demand post-GST cuts, while FMCG and realty stocks came under pressure from profit booking,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. Vodafone Idea (128.6 crore shares), Adani Power (19.25 crore shares), and YES Bank (8.24 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Banaras Beads, Emkay Global Financial Services, Brand Concepts, and Risa International were among the 12 stocks that jumped over 15 per cent on the BSE. Out of 4,311 stocks traded on the BSE, 1,797 advanced, while 2,354 declined. Some 160 stocks remained unchanged. Despite weak market sentiment, as many as 173 stocks, including Maruti Suzuki India, Tata Steel, Adani Power, Bajaj Finance, Canara Bank, Eicher Motors, and JSW Steel, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. SpiceJet, Symphony, Praj Industries, Pidilite Industries, and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals were among the 66 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, believes that the intraday market texture is volatile and non-directional. Hence, he suggests that level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the higher side, a break above 25,250 is likely to maintain bullish momentum. Above this level, the index could move up to 25,350-25,380, said Chouhan. On the flip side, a decline below 25,100 may accelerate further, and the index could slip to 25,000-24,950, Chouhan said. According to Bajaj Broking, the Nifty 50 formed a second consecutive high wave candle with a lower high and lower low in the daily chart. The brokerage firm expects the index to extend the same and trade in the range of 25,500–25,000 in the coming sessions. The immediate support base is at 25,100–24,900, which coincides with the confluence of the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA). \"We maintain the overall positive bias and believe the ongoing corrective pullback presents a tactical buying opportunity within the broader uptrend. On the upside, the index faces immediate resistance at the 25,500–25,600 zone,\" said the brokerage firm.

    "title": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50, India US trade deal to Trump tariffs; 8 stocks to buy or sell",
    "body": "Stock market news:The domestic benchmark indices, Nifty 50 and Sensex, reached a three-week low on Friday, experiencing their largest weekly decline in almost seven months, primarily due to US restrictions on H-1B visas and tariffs on branded medications affecting market sentiment. The Nifty 50 declined by 0.95% for the day, settling at 24,654.7, while the BSE Sensex fell by 0.9% to 80,426.46. Both indices recorded a loss of 2.7% over the week. The IT index dropped close to 8% for the week, marking its largest decline in roughly seven months, following President Donald Trump's implementation of a $100,000 charge on new H1-B visas. The pharma index fell by 2.1% on Friday and decreased by 5.2% over the week after Trump declared a 100% tax on branded and patented medications, set to take effect on October 1. As perAmruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking, the Nifty 50 index experienced significant bearish momentum this week, dropping 672 points and negating the previous two weeks' gains. On the daily chart, the index encountered strong resistance around the 25,500 level before declining, resulting in seven consecutive red candles, indicating persistent selling pressure and a negative sentiment. The index fell below the important 24,750 threshold, ultimately closing at 24,654. The Nifty 50 is now trading beneath its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, and it is nearing the 200-day EMA, signaling a deteriorating technical setup. A breakdown below 24,500 could lead to a further decline toward the 24,400 level (200-day EMA) and potentially down to 24,180. On the upside, immediate resistance levels are found at 24,750, then at 24,880, and finally at 25,000. If the index does not reclaim these levels, the short-term outlook is expected to remain negative. Vinod Nair, the Head of Research at Geojit Investments, noted that Indian equity markets ended the week with a lackluster performance, featuring declines across various sectors. The IT sector faced early setbacks due to concerns regarding increasing H-1B visa expenses, further exacerbated by Accenture's cautious forecast. The negative sentiment intensified as new US tariffs on pharmaceutical goods triggered a significant downturn in pharmaceutical stocks. Smaller and mid-cap stocks experienced more substantial declines than large-cap stocks, indicating strains from their elevated valuations. Looking forward, investors will focus on upcoming US economic reports, particularly those relating to inflation and employment figures. Domestically, the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision and industrial production statistics will be crucial in shaping market sentiment. The fundamental outlook for sectors like banking, FMCG, and automobiles remains positive, buoyed by supportive domestic policies and macroeconomic stability.

    "title": "The Rs 1.5 lakh stock that’s ‘bigger’ than the entire Nifty 50 universe",
    "body": "We have all encountered the familiar sight of a traditional weighing scale at a roadside vegetable vendor or fruit shop. At one end of the scale, weights are gradually added until the beam balances, indicating that the fruits, vegetables, or any other object being weighed matches the exact weight on the other side. This everyday scene got me thinking. What if we could apply the same principle to the stock market? What if we could weigh the price of the highest-priced stock in India, along with the stocks that make up the Nifty 50? MRF – The highest-priced stock in India Which is the highest-priced (costliest) actively traded stock in India? No prizes for guessing, it’s MRF Ltd. MRF brand has become synonymous with tyres. The company is engaged in manufacturing rubber products such as tyres, tubes, flaps, and tread rubber. MRF is a name that resonates beyond the stock market. Iconic cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Brian Lara, and AB de Villiers endorsing MRF bats. ALSO READ China’s export ban is fuelling India’s new gold rush: 3 stocks to watch MRF share price hits 52-week high, here’s why On September 23, MRF’s share price hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,56,400 per share on NSE. Two key factors contributed to this surge: the significant increase in auto sales following the GST cuts, and a recent development at the company’s Tiruvottiyur manufacturing plant in Chennai. The latter saw some employees go on strike regarding issues like the advance payment of annual insurance premiums and the hiring of trainees under various government schemes. MRF termed the strike an “illegal” action and noted in an exchange filing that the plant’s operations were partly continuing with the help of workers not involved in the protest. The company said it is actively working to restore normalcy at the plant as soon as possible. One share of MRF can buy you the entire Nifty 50 stock universe As of 2:15 PM on September 25, 2025, a single share of MRF is trading at Rs 1,50,660 on the NSE. To put this into perspective, when you compare it with the combined price of 1 share of all the constituents of the Nifty 50 , MRF still stands higher. ALSO READ This little-known realty stock is secretly building a Rs 10,000 crore data centre empire The total price of 1 share each of all Nifty 50 stocks is Rs 1,21,004, which includes blue-chip giants like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, and many others. MRF’s market cap vs Nifty 50 stocks’ market cap However, despite its high stock price, MRF’s market capitalisation stands at just over Rs 64,000 crore, which is significantly lower than all the Nifty 50 stocks, barring one. Among the Nifty 50 constituents, only IndusInd Bank, with a market cap of Rs 57,807 crore, has a lower market cap than MRF. Other stocks in the Nifty 50 have market caps exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore. To clarify, market capitalisation refers to the total value of a company’s shares in the stock market, calculated by multiplying the company’s share price by the number of shares in circulation. In simple terms, it’s a quick way to gauge the size or value of a company. Why MRF has become the most expensive stock in India: No stock split, no bonus shares Now, let’s understand how MRF, despite having a relatively low market cap, has become the highest-priced traded stock in the Indian markets. One of the key reasons for MRF’s status as the most expensive traded stock is its approach to corporate actions. Unlike many companies, which split their stock or issue bonus shares to bring the stock price down to a more psychologically appealing level, MRF has chosen not to take such actions. This has led to a lower number of shares in circulation, currently standing at a paltry 30.53 lakh. Shares in float refer to the number of a company’s outstanding shares available for trading in the open market, excluding those held by insiders or restricted. MRF share price performance Over the past decade, MRF’s stock has delivered multibagger returns, with absolute gains of 267.81 per cent, outperforming the Sensex (214.72 per cent) and the BSE Auto index (246.47 per cent). In the past six months alone, MRF has surged by 32.27 per cent, and on a year-to-date basis, it is up by 16.90 per cent. In essence, owning a single MRF share could give you access to the entire Nifty 50 universe, including some of India’s most prominent companies—from Adani and Ambani to Tata and beyond.

    "title": "An international dispute about a popular investment product could shape India's market",
    "body": "A dispute between stock exchanges inIndiaandSingaporehas cast doubts on a popular investment product, and it has raised questions about the future of India’s more than $2 trillion equity market. While the problem — a disagreement about the planned listing of a derivative product — may appear to be a niche one, it potentially affects a large swath of international investors with an interest in India. The contract at the heart of the dispute is the Nifty 50 index futures contract currently traded on the Singapore Exchange. According to industry players, that's one of the primary ways that investors around the world have been able to play the Indian market. The derivative product in Singapore is \"the incumbent, the largest and most liquid\" of futures contracts on offer, Ross Finlayson, on the iShares capital markets team at BlackRock, told CNBC. The National Stock Exchange of India has been providing data to the Singapore Exchange for the derivative product, which is used by offshore investors looking to hedge exposure to the Indian stock market. At present, many regard Indian equities as difficult to access because of the country's tax rules and other roadblocks. Now, that contract in Singapore is set to go away following an announcement from the NSE and two other Indian exchanges that they would be ending agreements to provide market data to overseas exchanges. That would affect the trading of offshore derivatives, including the SGX's Nifty 50 Index Futures. The NSE said the move was needed as derivative trading based on Indian securities had resulted in capital migrating offshore. That was “not in the best interest of Indian markets,” the NSE said in arelease. Following the announcement, the SGX said it would list newly created Indian derivative products, but its plans were dealt a blow by the NSE, which took the dispute to court. That was because the proposal was seen as identical to the incumbent SGX Nifty futures, local media outletThe Times of Indiasaid, citing sources. For now, the issue remains in a holding patter. An Indian court last monthorderedthe NSE toextendthe existing license for SGX Nifty futures for at least two successive contract months after arbitration — which the Indian stock exchange said is expected in February 2019 — is completed. Both the SGX and NSE told CNBC they had no additional updates on the matter beyond statements released last month. Investors have been left with plenty of uncertainty in the wake of those developments. Interest in Nifty futures on the SGX has tapered: Volumes of the derivative traded on the SGX have slipped from above the 2 million mark per month to consistently coming in below that level from March onward. The dispute makes things difficult for investors trying to get exposure to Indian equities, thus potentially increasing costs for those looking to access the Indian market, said Zhikai Chen, a Hong Kong-based portfolio director at Lombard Odier. And even though the NSE's existing license has been prolonged for now, investors are unlikely to wait until the last moment before scrambling for alternatives in the scenario the arbitrator rules in the Indian stock exchange's favor. That's because India has a roughly 8.5 percent weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and those tracking that benchmark need to ensure they have exposure to the Indian market. \"From one day to the next, it's very difficult for these managers to be sitting in a limbo as to whether they know they can access that exposure,\" Finlayson said. There aren't too many alternatives that investors caught in the middle can turn to for now, Finlayson said, citing other smaller futures contracts and less liquid derivatives as examples of options. He added that interest in one of BlackRock's recently launched exchange-traded funds focusing on Indian equities had spiked since the two exchanges began legal proceedings. “Because of this turbulence in the market, no one’s really too sure as to the viability of this new product and the overhanging court proceedings obviously bring it a little more into disrepute as well,” Finlayson said of the new India stock futures the SGX plans to launch. Another potential casualty could be the onshore Indian equity market as liquidity could take a knock if arbitrage trading between the two stock exchanges is affected by SGX Nifty futures being halted, said Dbritto Ronald Michael, senior development manager at brokerage Phillip Futures. All of that also comes against the backdrop of the development of the Gujarat International Finance-Tec (GIFT) City, a district in Gujarat state positioned by the Indian government as a high-tech hub for financial services. Concessions, such as exemptions from short-term capital gains taxes on derivative trades made in GIFT City for foreigners, are being made to encourage offshore trading volumes to return onshore.

    "body": "Budget 2018: Indian stock markets ended marginally lower on Thursday as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the last full-year Budget before the Lok Sabha Elections in 2019. Investors all across are keenly awaiting for the Union Budget 2018 as it was the first budget after the nation-wide constitutional reform GST (Goods and Services Tax) implemented in July 2017. The benchmark Sensex extended yesterday’s losses to close slightly lower and Nifty index also saw a little decline but managed to end above 11,000-mark. Earlier yesterday, Indian stock markets ended marginally lower ahead of the Union Budget 2018 with Sensex and Nifty finishing in negative territory for the second consecutive day. Meanwhile, US stock markets concluded slightly higher on Wednesday as indices gave up early gains after the US Federal Reserve said it sees inflation rising this year, signalling it remains on track to boost interest rates again in March, Reuters said in a report. The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged but, in a statement following its two-day policy meeting, it repeated that it expected that “further gradual” rate hikes will be warranted, Reuters added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.74 points or 0.28% to 26,150.63, the S&P 500 gained 1.47 points or 0.05% to 2,823.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.00 points or 0.12% to 7,411.48. — Indian stock market activity on the day when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tabled Budget 2018 — 15:30 pm: Closing Bell | Indian stock markets finished marginally lower on the Budget 2018 day, Thursday in a heavy volatile trading activity with stocks of pharma and PSU bank dropping the most. The benchmark Sensex extended yesterday’s losses to close slightly lower and Nifty index also saw a little decline but managed to end above 11,000-mark. BSE Sensex lost 58.36 points or 0.16% to conclude at 35,906.66 and NSE Nifty shed 10.8 points or 0.1% to settle at 11,016.9. During the day, the S&P BSE Sensex plunged 463.28 points to hit an 8-day low of 35,501.74 while Nifty washed away 148.9 points to hit an 8-day low at 10,878.8.

This image shows the 30 shares of S&P BSE Sensex index after the stock markets were closed on Thursday. (Image: BSE) Shares of Heavyweight companies such as Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India , Sun Pharma, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki, and Infosys contributed heavily to the Sensex losses. Jointly, these eight stocks washed away as much as 238 points out of the 58-point drop in the Sensex. While a sustained uptick in the shares of L&T, ITC, M&M, HDFC, IndusInd Bank, TCS, and Kotak Mahindra Bank helped to trim partial losses in the index, adding 193 points to the index. This image shows the point-wise contribution of 8 stocks which led the Sensex fall on Thursday. (Image: BSE) Among the PSU bank stocks, shares of Syndicate Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank , Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda , Indian Bank, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Andhra Bank, and Bank of India lost 2-5% with benchmark Nifty PSU Bank index shedding 2.3% to finish at 3,597.1. 15:20 pm: Indian equities again fell into negative territory in the last 30 minutes of trade with Sensex trading 63.72 points lower at 35,901.3 as stocks of blue-chip companies such as RIL, ICICI Bank, and HDFC hovering in the red. 15:05 pm: In Union Budget 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has announced various agricultural reforms in a bid to double farmer income by 2022.

(Image: ANI) 12:50 pm: “Arun Jaitley on introducing LTCG at 10%” “Madam Speaker, currently, long-term capital gains arising from transfer of listed equity shares, units of equity oriented fund and unit of a business trust are exempt from tax. With the reforms introduced by the government and incentives given so far, the equity market has become buoyant. The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and units is around Rs 3,67,000 crores as per returns filed for the assessment year 2017-2018,” Arun Jaitley said. “Major part of this gain has accrued to corporates and LLPs. This has also created a bias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being invested in financial assets. The return on investment in equity is already quite attractive even without tax exemption,” Arun Jaitley said further. “There is, therefore, a strong case for bringing long-term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net . However, recognising the fact that vibrant equity market is essential for economic growth, I propose only a modest change in the present regime. I propose to tax such long-term capital gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh at the rate of 10% without allowing the benefit of any indexation. However, all gains up to 31st January 2018 will be grandfathered,” Arun Jaitley added. “Example provided by the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley” For example, if an equity share is purchased six months before 31st January 2018 at Rs 100/- and the highest price quoted on 31st January 2018 in respect of this share is Rs 120/-, there will be no tax on the gain of Rs 20/- if this share is sold after one year from the date of purchase. However, any gain in excess of Rs 20 earned after 31st January, 2018 will be taxed at 10% if this share is sold after 31st July 2018. The gains from equity share held up to one year will remain short-term capital gain and will continue to be taxed at the rate of 15%. 12:43 pm: Indian equities witness heavy sell-off pressure following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s introducing an LTCG tax at 10%.

    "title": "Nearly 50% of Nifty companies trading at a discount; should you buy or stay put?",
    "body": "Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations. About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These includeTata Steel,ONGC,Coal India,NTPC,JSW Steel,IOC,Gail India,Axis Bank,Power Grid, among others. Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether? Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks. A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment. The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time. “We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said. Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names? “One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol. “Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said. How relevant are long term averages? Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts. The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages. “Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol. “It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

    "title": "Market Highlights: Sensex plunges 770 points, Nifty settles below 10,800-level",
    "body": "The Indian equity market on Tuesday closed amid macroeconomic data, auto sales number and global cues. Sensex closed 769.88 points, or 2.06%, at 36,562.91 while the broader Nifty settled at 10,797.90 tumbling 225.35 points, or 2.04%. Investors were worried on economy slowdown, GDP data and merger of the the PSU Banks announced late on Friday. Also, the auto sales data which was released over the weekend likely to increase the nervousness of the Dalal Street. \"Market slid as deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. The consolidation of PSU banks is a step in right direction however, they may take more time before earning benefits from synergy. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflow from foreign investors added volatility to rupee,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. In the broader market, both the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices slipped 1.65% and 1.32% respectively. ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank and Vedanta were the worst performing stocks, crashing as much as 4.45%. On NSE, 48 out of 50 stocks ended in the red zone with Tata Steel and UltraTech Cement taking the top position among the losers. Only Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies were the gainers on the 50-share index. “The sharp fall in the Q1 GDP growth to 5% and the weak core sector growth are the key factors that have caused a fall in the markets as it opened after a long weekend. The continuing negative global cues, the raging tariff war between the US and China, and the likely sluggishness in the economic fortunes of economies around the world have also been behind the rot in the markets here as well as elsewhere. Weak domestic consumption especially rural consumption has resulted mainly from low employment levels and non-availability of finance, which are issues that call for immediate measures to salvage the situation,” said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research- Emkay Wealth Management. Among sectors, Nifty PSU Banks was the biggest loser, falling 4.87%, followed by Metal (-3.10%), Media (-2.59%), Private Banks (-2.34%) and Financial Services (-2.28%). Globally, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.2% in early trade while Japan's Nikkei was flat. The US bond yields were little changed in early Tuesday trade after a market holiday in the United States on Monday. The 10-year US Treasuries yield was flat at 1.506%.

Sensex closed 769.88 points, or 2.06%, at 36,562.91 while the broader Nifty settled at 10,797.90 tumbling 225.35 points, or 2.04%. The 30-share index plunged 802 points, or 2.15%, to 36,529.83. Nifty PSU Bank sector is down 4.73% with Indian Bank (-10.88%) taking the pole position among top losers followed by Canara Bank (-10.29%), Union Bank (-8.33%), Punjab National Bank (-8.24%) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (7.07%). Midcap stocks continue to decline. BSE Midcap index is trading 1.55% lower with Indian Bank (10.84%) being the top loser. “Cabinet clears recapitalization of IDBI Bank with one-time infusion of funds by both Government and LIC.

Markets already had rallied on Monday and today after the trends started confirming BJP's win Sensex and Nifty hit their new highs. But now the market will have to catch up with ground realities of the economy and global factors. Global markets are showing weakness due to US-China trade worries and so our market may settle down or even turn negative in the short term. Traders must stay cautious now. Looking at technicals, Nifty has support around 11,730 levels, breaching it on downside might result in more downside towards 11,600, On the upside, any close above 11,800 may take the Nifty above 12,000. Infra and Banking sector may give good returns on the upside. We are positive on DLF, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank.\" 14:59 (IST) 23 May 2019 B Gopkumar, ED and CEO, Reliance Securities on election results: \"Markets were looking for stability, continuity and strong leadership rather than a fractured mandate - this has led to the new high.

Rising markets make the stocks expensive, and hence it would be not the right time to jump in. Nevertheless, it is also recommended that investors hold on to their investments and wait for their financial goals to achieve. My expectations from the new government for the Mutual Fund Industry are – Scheme portability – The option to switch from one AMC scheme to another AMC scheme within the same asset class should be made available to investors without any extra cost & tax incidence. FOF as Equity Scheme – Revise the definition of “Equity Oriented Funds” (EOF) by including Fund of Funds (FOF) schemes which invest predominantly i.e., 65% or more, in units of Equity Oriented Mutual Fund Schemes. Taxation – Taxation of Fixed Income products and bonds if transacted in the capital market to be similar. Pension Funds – Mutual Funds to be permitted along with tax benefit, management of pension funds. Economy – Fiscal deficit to be controlled and financial discipline to be instilled without falling prey to populist measures.\" 14:03 (IST) 23 May 2019 Nifty PSU Bank index up over 1.5 per cent, top gainers and losers among the PSU banks The Nifty PSU Bank index on the National Stock Exchange is up over 1.5 per cent.

(Source: Comapny release to BSE) 12:51 (IST) 23 May 2019 Surendra Hiranandani, Founder and Director, House of Hiranandani on real estate sector: The real estate sector was in the news in the last couple of years, with the government announcing several major policy initiatives like demonetization, RERA, GST etc which changed the entire landscape of the industry and made it buyer friendly. Housing remains the top priority for every Indian regardless of their income levels, education or any other possible factor and we believe that a stable government at the centre in 2019 will further boost the growth in the sector. We hope that the new government demonstrates concrete action to push investments, increase growth and generate employment. We expect that the new government can do away with unnecessary documentation which will help real estate players immensely. It is important that single window clearance is soon put into practice which will not only resolve operational issues prevalent in the industry but would improve the productivity of the real estate industry. Currently, the permissions are coming at a snail’s pace. Private sector participation in housing is necessary to bridge the gap between demand and supply and for that it is desirable to create a policy framework to minimise and simplify approvals required for the development of a real estate project. Real Estate sector stands amongst the critical sectors in terms of investments and employment and we look forward to initiatives that would further aid to the growth of the sector in the near future. 12:43 (IST) 23 May 2019 Japan's Nippon Life Insurance to raise stake in Reliance Capital-owned asset manager to 75 per cent Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management said on Thursday its Japanese investor would increase its stake in the Mumbai-based asset manager to 75 per cent.

(Source: Reuters) 12:22 (IST) 23 May 2019 Nilkhil Kamath, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer, Zerodha: \"The elections have played out in line with consensus opinion, BJP looks like they will have a majority even outside the alliances that form the NDA. Consistency in leadership is a positive for the economy overall and should shore up sentiment amongst foreign investors. This could lead to Rupee strengthening and benchmark yields coming down over the short term. Specific to the Indian stock market; we believe they might have run up ahead of fundamentals buoyed by sentiment over the short term. It might be prudent to wait for the inherent fundamentals to catch up before waging big directional bets on the market right now.\" 12:16 (IST) 23 May 2019 NEWS FLASH | Government has to improve ease of doing business: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala to CNBC TV18 Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in an interview with CNBC TV18 has said that the new government has to improve ease of doing business. 12:09 (IST) 23 May 2019 Market Check Market situation at 12:06 pm 11:33 (IST) 23 May 2019 NEWS FLASH| 7.26 per cent 2029 Government Bond Yield at lowest level since April 2018: CNBC TV18 The 7.26 per cent 2029 Government Bond Yield is at the lowest level since April 2018 (Source: CNBC TV18) 11:21 (IST) 23 May 2019 S&P BSE SmallCap index up nearly 1 per cent The S&P BSE SmallCap index was at 14,493, up 124 points or 0.9 per cent.

For the day, the index will take its direction from the outcome of the general election trends which will be available during the market hours. We expect the volatility is to spike in the today’s trade amid the big political event. The index has support around 11650 followed by 11500 while resistance is pegged around 11880 and 12000 levels. On the flip side, BANKNIFTY is having support around 30250 and 30000 levels while resistance is pegged around 30700 and 30950 levels. Sectors to watch for the day: We remain bullish on select private sector banks followed by Auto and FMCG counters for the day. While any bounce in the Pharma and IT stocks may be used to exit the existing long positions.

Weakness was visible among index heavyweights, which dragged the indices. Meanwhile, among sectors, auto, metals and pharmaceuticals were all trading in the green. At the close of market hours, the Sensex was down 8.39 points or 0.02% at 36068.33, and the Nifty up 2.60 points or 0.02% at 10862.50. The market breadth was narrow as 1495 shares advanced, against a decline of 1095 shares, while 164 shares were unchanged. Tata Steel, Vedanta, and JSW Steel were the top gainers, while Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel lost the most.",

Nascent signs have appeared, even though an enduring setback is not yet visible. The Reserve Bank of India reported, recently, that credit quality deteriorated in June 2019, with rise in stressed and NPA ratios in all sectors except industry (Monetary Policy Report, October). Although the central bank did not provide numbers, charted trend shows the gross NPA ratio closer to 10% from 9.3% in March, which represented a four-quarter successive decline.

There is also no confirmation on whether the Government will introduce such Bill in the upcoming session of Parliament.

LIC manages assets in excess of Rs 31 lakh crore as of July end this year. Adding, he said that the insurer sees plenty of high growth from here despite the ongoing slowdown in the economy, ET Now reported. LIC has seen slowdown cycles before as well and it will ride over it too, LIC Chairman added. Even as the slowdown has hit the insurance sector, LIC has done well as against the private sector peers and also managed to get some of the lost market share in the smaller cities, MK Kumar noted. Full story 13:45 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Portfolio Management Services (PMS) vs MF: How both investments have fared in 5 years In the last five years, Mutual Fund sector has seen a “spectacular growth” due to a combination of increasing awareness, rising markets, Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)’s marketing campaigns, advancement of various new-age distributors. All these have resulted in the Asset Under Management (AUM) increasing by 186 per cent to $340 billion and the folio base jumping about 110 per cent to 82.5 million, according to Vasanth Kamath, Co-Founder and CEO, Smallcase Technologies. Full story 12:36 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Monsoon effect: Late kharif harvesting may hit rabi sowing and output Barring bajra, moong and sunflower, market arrivals of all other kharif crops are now lower than a year ago mainly due to late sowing during the monsoon season and excess rains in September. If this trend continues for a longer while, the sowing of key rabi crops like wheat, mustard and chana may get delayed, potentially bringing down their yield as northern India has been witnessing above-normal temperature from March, the month when rabi harvesting commences, during the past few years.

Regulations and compliances have, however, become stricter in recent times. In light of recent macroeconomic developments and a decelerating growth environment, there is credit crunch, as well as growing scrutiny on the broader financial sector. This has led to increases in the cost of borrowing and players are grappling with higher unit economics implications.

Full story 12:15 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Make Rs 3.6 lakh for just Rs 5000/month with Post Office: Check calculation formula Post Office Recurring Deposit Calculation formula: If you are looking to save each month in a fixed deposit on a recurring basis, the recurring deposit (RD) can be the right investment option that has a fixed rate of interest. An RD is like an account into which one needs to invest the same amount each month for a fixed period. In banks, one can open RD account for any period, however, in a post office, an RD can be opened for a fixed period of 5 years only. Currently, the interest rate on the post office recurring deposit (PO RD) is higher than what most banks offer on their 5-year bank RD scheme. In SBI and HDFC Bank, the recurring deposit rate of interest are 6.25 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively.

Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA are in talks to combine in a deal that could create a $50 billion automaker, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Fiat Chrysler shares rose sharply after news of the talks and ended up more than 7.5% in U.S. trading. The companies and the French government had no comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the discussions. PSA's supervisory board was due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential merger, another source close to the matter said. Full story 11:31 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Telecom woes: Vodafone Idea seeks debt revamp as losses mount; Reliance Jioâ€™s free calls adds more trouble Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture, reeling under $14 billion of net debt, mounting losses and dwindling subscribers, has approached creditors for better payment terms to revive the sinking carrier, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Vodafone Idea Ltd., formed by last year’s merger of the British telecommunications firm’s local unit with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd., has warned lenders that it won’t be able to honor its commitments for long under current conditions, the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private. One of its requests was a temporary halt to loan payments, although no formal proposal has been made, two of the people said. Full story 11:15 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Letâ€™s get realistic about BSNL revival Ever since the press critiqued the government’s Rs 70,000 crore bailout package for BSNL-MTNL, BSNL supporters have called it ill-informed, and one-sided; it does not, for instance, take into account the tens of thousands of crores of private telecom debt that PSU banks will have to write off. Indeed, if the debt owed by telcos to the government is added, the figure could runs into lakhs of crores; while companies like RCom and Aircel are already in the insolvency courts, many believe Vodafone-Idea is running out of funds to sustain operations. And, after the Supreme Court judgment on AGR, you can add another Rs 1.33 lakh crore to private sector telecom debt. Put that way, the argument is a sound one: why is writing off private sector debt okay, but a bailout for the public sector problematic? Full story 11:06 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 OYO, MMT under scanner after industry body complains; CCI orders probe Competition watchdog CCI has ordered an investigation against hospitality company OYO and online travel agency Go-MMT after industry body FHRAI filed a complaint alleging unfair business practices and destroying competition. The Competition Commission of India also said that there was a prima facie case for investigation against Ritesh Agarwal-founded OYO and Go-MMT, the entity made after the merger of GoIbibo and MakeMyTrip. The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) alleged that the “opposite parties have abused their respective dominant positions, they have cartelized and further, they have entered into anti-competitive agreements/agreements,” CCI note said. Full story 10:54 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Population grows at double pace than jobs in India; rural employment remains stagnant Ever since the results of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2017-18 became public — they showed that unemployment in India was at a 45-year high — there has been a vigorous public debate about the true state of unemployment in the country. What has fueled this debate — and allowed different people to arrive at differing conclusions about the state of unemployment — has been the long delays in the availability of past employment data, even though PLFS tracks employment annually. Full story 10:47 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Bank employees salary negotiation: What has stalled a settlement for over two years A wage revision settlement for over 10 lakh bank employees and officers has been stuck for two years due to serious differences between the bank management and unions. According to banking industry sources, though there was a broad agreement over the Indian Banking Association’s offer of a 12% hike in the wage cost but the talks were derailed for over a year as four officers associations wanted the inclusion of bank officers of all seven scales in the proposed settlement. In addition to this, now a majority of unions and associations are not willing to accept less than 15% hike which was the case with the last wage revision settlement that was applicable for a period of five years, from 2012 to 2017. Full story 10:33 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Govt forms high-level panel to look at bailout package for Airtel, Vodafone Idea, other telcos The government has constituted a committee of secretaries to explore a financial bailout package for the telecom sector by lowering spectrum charges as well as ending the era of free mobile phone calls and dirt cheap data as companies look at the government for avoiding payment of thousands of crores of rupees in overdue statutory levies. The Committee of Secretaries, headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, has been asked to examine “all aspects” of “financial stress” faced by service providers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea and suggest measures to mitigate them, sources in the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said. Full story 10:29 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Input Tax Credit: New GST refund rules create confusion as deadline to file first returns comes close Millions of GST payers are eagerly awaiting clarity over the new rules notified early this month that restricted the refund of input tax credit to 20% of the total claimed amount. The GST registered businesses will begin uploading their returns from next week and it will be the first occasion when they will file their returns under the new rules governing the refund of the input tax credit. On October 9, the GST council notified new rules under section 43 of the GST law that restricts the refund amount to 20% of the claimed amount if the suppliers have not uploaded correct details in the GSTR 1 form uploaded on GSTN portal. Businesses are expected to face challenges this month onwards due to the lack of clarity on the applicability of this rule, said Pritam Mahure, a Mumbai based Chartered Accountant. Full story 10:28 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Several panels later, Indiaâ€™s export sector a laggard, cries for bold policy push Even as the government is set to release the report of a high-level advisory group under noted economist Surjit Bhalla on ways to boost exports, recommendations of similar panels in the past have hardly been implemented. Inadequate government action has often rendered the practice of setting up panels largely irrelevant, while the country’s export growth continues to remain below par and miss targets frequently. Various committees, working groups, inter-ministerial pa-nels have, in the past, suggested steps to address structural hurdles,including elevated logistics costs, inflexible labour laws and inverted/distorted duty structure (especially in textiles), whi-ch continue to cripple India’s ex-port competitiveness. Archaic labour laws have long militated against firms acquiring size and scale in critical jobs-intensive se-ctors, while logistics costs make up for as much as 15-16% of exporters’ consignment value. Full story 10:11 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Bond vigilantes in India worry too much, must trust Modi administration, says IDBI banker Ashok Gautam is betting that India will achieve its fiscal deficit target this year. That makes him something of a rare breed among investors in the nation’s bond market. Gautam, a banker for nearly thirty-five years, is counting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s administration’s past fiscal-track record, which shows it can generate funds to plug revenue gaps. That, he said, would remove a major impediment to a debt rally, which could see the benchmark 10-year yield slip to near a three-year low as the Reserve Bank of India cuts rates further. Full story 09:59 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 RCEP: Ball squarely in PM Modiâ€™s court With barely a week left for countries to make their positions clear on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the ball lies in Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s court, as he will take the final call on whether India would be part of the mega regional trade deal or not, sources told FE. A leaders’ summit, to be attended by the heads of the 16 RCEP nations, is scheduled to be held in Bangkok next week, where the deal was supposed to be announced. The deal faces fierce domestic resistance from not just industries, including steel and dairy, but also the government departments overseeing these sectors, thanks to persisting fears of dumping by countries like China. Full story 09:43 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Competition act: Regulator orders probe against MakeMyTrip-Ibibo and OYO The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has stated in an order dated October 28 that there is a prima facie case for investigation against MakeMyTrip India-Ibibo Group (MMT-Go) and Oravel Stays (OYO) for alleged violations of the Competition Act. The order is in response to a complaint filed by the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI). The CCI said that there is a prima facie case for investigation against MMT-Go and OYO for alleged violation of the provisions of Section 3(4) of the Act, which deals with anti-competitive agreements. A prima facie case for investigation under Section 4 of the Act, which deals with abuse of dominant position, has also been made out against MMT-Go. The CCI has sought a report on the investigation within 150 days.

IndiGo share price jumoed more than 3% to hit the day's high at Rs 1,454 on BSE. Budget carrier IndiGo on Tuesday placed orders for 300 Airbus A320 neo family aircraft. The order comprises a mix of A320neo, A321neo and long-range A321XLR aircraft. This will take IndiGo’s total number of A320neo Family aircraft orders to 730, the airline said in a statement. 09:32 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Analyst corner: Strong Q2 by JLR; Tata Sons to infuse Rs 6,500 crore JLR’s Q2 performance was well ahead of estimates as margins improved sharply y-o-y and q-o-q, helped by multiple factors, including mix and project charge. Guidance was maintained as it expects to remain profitable in seasonally stronger H2. Losses were higher than expected in India business partly due to a Rs 230-crore write-off in PV business. Tata Sons plans to infuse Rs 6,500 crore of equity into Tata Motors, which should support the balance sheet, given rising leverage.

A look at LIVE Sensex heatmap. 09:14 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Stock corner: Maintain â€˜buyâ€™ on SBI on undemanding valuations State Bank of India’s (SBI) Q2FY20 saw a beat on asset quality vs our muted expectations. PPOP was in line with a positive NII, offset by higher-than-expected opex. Granular slippages normalised and corporate stress formation was also low at Rs 3,400 crore. The watch list (standard IBC + SMA 1/2) is at Rs 26,000 crore (1.2% of loans); including one more large HFC and a telecom group, we estimate the total stress pool at 2.2% of loans, which looks manageable to us now. Full story 09:01 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Insolvency Code progress report: Nearly 4 times as many cases in liquidation as in resolution In over three years of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the number of bankrupt companies liquidated under the regime has far exceeded the number of corporate resolutions, by nearly four times, somewhat defying the actual purpose of the new system. While 156 of the cases admitted under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) have been resolved till September 2019, the liquidation process has started in as many as 587 cases, according to the data released by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India. Thus, IBC has liquidated many more companies than it has resolved, against its primary purpose of resolving insolvency and bankruptcy cases to bring sick companies bank to revival.

PPOP was in line with a positive NII, offset by higher-than-expected opex. Granular slippages normalised and corporate stress formation was also low at Rs 3,400 crore. The watch list (standard IBC + SMA 1/2) is at Rs 26,000 crore (1.2% of loans); including one more large HFC and a telecom group, we estimate the total stress pool at 2.2% of loans, which looks manageable to us now.

Inadequate government action has often rendered the practice of setting up panels largely irrelevant, while the country’s export growth continues to remain below par and miss targets frequently. Various committees, working groups, inter-ministerial pa-nels have, in the past, suggested steps to address structural hurdles,including elevated logistics costs, inflexible labour laws and inverted/distorted duty structure (especially in textiles), whi-ch continue to cripple India’s ex-port competitiveness. Archaic labour laws have long militated against firms acquiring size and scale in critical jobs-intensive se-ctors, while logistics costs make up for as much as 15-16% of exporters’ consignment value.

    "body": "Indian benchmark indices on Mondayclosed at record highsonce again as market sentiment remains high. S&P BSE Sensex rose 1 per cent or 486.81 points to 49,269.32, while NSE Nifty 50 ended at a record closing peak of 14,484.75, up almost one per cent. A good start to the quarterly earnings season, ongoing vaccination developments and hopes of a higher stimulus package in the US boosted domestic markets in India. Higher foreign fund inflows also contributed to domestic market’s performance today. The rally in IT stocks was a major reason behind higher optimism on the trading floors of Dalal Street. IT stocks led from the front today and remained top gainers on the indices. Top gainers on the 30-share Sensex pack included technology firms like HCL Tech, Infosys, TCS, and Tech Mahindra — all of them had gained between 2 to 6 per cent on the BSE. The Nifty IT index also closed 3.3 per cent higher at 27,027.75. The robust earning performance from TCS also helped today’s rally and boosted markets. The technology giant gained after reporting blockbuster third-quarter results. The company’s shares rose by almost three per cent in morning trade before closing almost 1.6 per cent higher. Read |Sensex tops 49,000 as TCS earnings boost IT stocks, Nifty above 14,400 \"The expectations of results from blue-chips are very high. The global markets are good and liquidity is also coming. The sentiment is so solid that markets are not concerned about valuations. This (up)trend is looking difficult to break,\" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. Another factor that contributed to domestic market optimism on Monday was good news regarding the vaccine rollout. It has been confirmed by the government that phase one of themass vaccination against Covid-19 will begin from January 16. Market participants are keenly awaiting the mass vaccination drive to start as it will further lead to further easing of economic activity. It may be noted that India has authorised two Covid-19 vaccines till date — Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca & Serum Institute of India vaccine Covishield for emergency use. Read |India's vaccine cost-effective, vaccination to begin from Jan 16: PM Modi The first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive is expected to start by January 16 with health care workers, frontline workers and the elderly. There are a bunch of other factors that have boosted market optimism. Higher foreign fund inflows, the possibility of a bigger US stimulus package and buzzing auto stocks also helped boost market optimism. Market investors are optimistic ahead of the government’s upcoming budget, which will be crucial for India’s economic revival. Although the government is tight on finances due to additional Covid-19 expenditure, it is likely to go for higher spending in its budget to boost growth and demand.",

    "title": "Nifty 50 at 17,500 level! What's next? The road ahead for investors",
    "body": "Nifty 50 at 17,500 level! What's next? The key benchmark Indian stock market index, Nifty 50 is swinging at an unprecedented 17,500 levels (approx.) and the free-float market-weighted stock market index, Sensex breached the elusive 55,000 marks recently. The Indian stock markets witnessed the Bull Run and massive rally for the first time ever, and it may make a record of new levels every day. Keeping all this in mind, it becomes extremely important for an investor to do a fundamental check about whether all these unprecedented runs are being supported by basic data or not, and how much strength do these levels possess? Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman of GCL Securities Private Limited, suggests that there is no need to worry about a higher level of these stock market indices because the price of any stock or index is always a reflection of its earning base. \"All of us are well aware of the fact that the pandemic has hit the earnings of businesses very badly. Hence, now when businesses are bouncing back into financial action, the earnings of almost every company is improving in their quarterly results,\" he said. While looking at the consolidated earnings of Nifty 50 companies, it was at almost Rs 358 per share, average in August 2020, and has been continuously improving since then. The same figure was at an average of Rs 446 in April 2021 and Rs 607 in August 2021. \"Therefore, if we look at the PE data of this year, it is continuously on a decline, even though the key indices are touching new levels,\" he said. Keeping in mind the above-cited data, now, a big question emerges here - Is it worth buying in Nifty 50 at 26.25 P/E? To answer this, we have to look into some of the key facts here:- 1. Historical P/E:FY 2020-21 was an exception, therefore we cannot take the data of this year into consideration while calculating the average. However, if we look at historical data of the past 5 years before FY'21, the Nifty 50 P/E average was 24.78 from the beginning of FY 2015-16 till the end of FY 2019-20. Therefore, at 26.25 level it is almost 6% higher than last 5 years average. 2. Nifty 50 P/E calculation:As we know, NSE has changed the calculation method for Nifty 50 P/E. Now it is calculated on the basis of consolidated earnings of all the companies instead of standalone P/E. This calculation has changed P/E data significantly. It is important to note here that after that this calculation change came into effect, Nifty 50 P/E immediately came at 33.2 on 31st March 2021 from 40.43. 3. Future growth:If we evaluate the P/E of any company or any of the indices, we must look at the future earnings expectations as well. Current higher P/E may be a result of market expectations of higher earnings in the future. Conclusion:P/E is the most important factor for market strength analysis and it is running higher than its 5 years average. It may be the result of the market expectation of higher earnings growth of Nifty 50 companies but at the same time, we also expect that earnings will improve further as the festive season will perform well and the monsoon is going good all over India. Finally, long-term investors who have 3-5 years of investment horizon should not fear at all from the levels of 16,500 and 55,000 of Nifty 50 and Sensex respectively.",

    "body": "Rs 7 lakh invested in Nifty50 today can make you double crorepati by 2051 Amitabh Tiwari · Columnist 28 July 2021 3 min read by Taboola by Taboola You May Like Sobha Town Park on Hosur Road. Luxury 2 & 3 BHK Near Electronic City Metro. Pay 20% Now! Sobha Townpark • Ad Ad Learn More Undo The Nifty50 turned 25 this year on April 22. It started with a base of 1,000 and is currently trading at 15,867. In its 25-year-long journey, the index has risen almost 16 times its original base. In terms of returns, it has generated returns of around 11.5% per annum for the past 25 years. On the other hand, the BSE Sensex launched in 1979, completed 42 years this year in April. It has generated returns of around 16% per annum for the past 40-plus years. These are no mean achievements. Just Rs 20,000 invested in Sensex in 1979 when it was launched would have made you a crorepati today. Rs 7 lakh invested in NIfty50 in 1996, when it was launched, would have made you a crorepati today. This is the power of compounding, the benefit of staying put and investing with a long term view. Many people who invested similar amounts or higher could have fulfilled their milestone goals like daughter’s marriage, children’s foreign education or retirement. Indian markets, like other global markets, are on a roll since recovering from a crash precipitated by the pandemic last year. Rising cases globally and spread of delta variant, high inflation, and other fears are being ignored by the markets. Indian markets have doubled from levels seen in March last year. In the last one year, Indian markets have generated the 3rd highest returns worldwide. Liquidity, and lack of other profitable investment avenues have made equities most sought after. More than a crore new demat accounts have been opened in the last year. With interest rates on fixed deposits low (around 5.5% for 5 year FD), inflation high 6%+, investors are making negative real returns on term deposits. The real estate market is in a flux. In metros rents have fallen sharply after the lockdown as employees moved back home. Despite the devastation caused by the pandemic, Indian economy has bounced back strongly with GDP growth of 1.6% in Q4 of the financial year (FY) 2020-21. IMF projections for FY 2021-22 suggest India would again become the world's fastest-growing large economy. The growth story for India is intact and we are in a multi-year bull run cycle as projected by many experts like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Raamdeo Agarwal and others. The Sensex could touch 200,000 points in the next 10 years, according to Raamdeo Agrawal on account of favourable factors like steady economic growth over the last few years and key indicators such as democracy, demography, digitisation, dollar reserves, and a stable government. This translates to a per annum growth of 15% which is still 1% lower than what Sensex has achieved till date. Story continues According to ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala , India is on a roll and the stock market will continue to boom. He expects Nifty50 to touch 100,000 points by 2030. This translates into a 20% per annum return which is very bullish in my opinion. A Times of India analysis on 30 years of economic reforms projects the Sensex to reach 100,000 points by 2027 and 1,500,000 by 2051! Both these projections are attainable as they assume an annual growth of 12%, which is equal to historical growth returned by Nifty50. This means that Rs 7 lakh invested in the markets today — Nifty50 or Sensex — could fetch you Rs 2 crore by 2051. You could then become a double crorepati in the next thirty years by the time you retire by investing merely Rs 7 lakh.

    "title": "Sensex tanks 3%, Nifty sub-13,350; bears take control of markets on virus scare",
    "body": "Welcome to the Mint live blog. Track this space for the latest stock market updates. Indian benchmark equity indices--Sensex and Nifty--fell 3% each on Monday, snapping six days of gains, as investor appetite soured following reports of a new deadly strain of the coronavirus in the UK. The Sensex slumped 1406.73 points or 3% to close at 45,553.96 while the Nifty ended 432.15 points or 3.1% lower at 13,328.40. About 580 shares advanced, 2,381 declined, and 163 shares were unchanged. All Nifty sectoral indices tanked 2-7% each while broader market indices Nifty Smallcap100 and Nifty Midcap100 fell 5% each. The BSE lost over₹7 trillion in market capitalisation today. The Indian rupee, meanwhile, ended 21 paise lower at 73.78 per dollar amid selling pressure in domestic equities. Oil prices tumbled by $2 on Monday, as a fast-spreading new strain of coronavirus that has shut down much of the UK and led to tighter restrictions in Europe sparked worries about a slower recovery in fuel demand. Brent crude was down $2.06, or 3.9%, to $50.20 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down $1.95, or 4%, at $47.15 a barrel. As a measure of abundant precaution, passengers arriving from THE UK in all transit flights (flights that have taken off or flights which are reaching India before 22nd Dec at 23.59 hrs) should be subject to mandatory RT-PCR test on arrival at the airports concerned, the civil aviation ministry said in a tweet. M&M says SsangYong files for commencement of rehabilitation procedure with Seoul Bankruptcy Court. It has also applied for autonomous restructuring support (ARS) programme. Seoul Bankruptcy Court will deliberate and review the application. If the Court approves the ARS, SYMC will continue to function under the supervision of its Board and will negotiate with stakeholders to reach an understanding about a revival package which may include equity and debt financing and other related actions. However, some of its decisions will be subject to Court approval. SpiceJet Ltd and IndiGo promoter InterGlobe Aviation were down over 4% each on Monday on reports of countries banning flights from the UK following the discovery of a new deadly strain of coronavirus. Oil fell toward $47 a barrel -- after posting a seventh weekly gain -- on concern a mutation of Covid-19 discovered in the U.K. could speed transmission of the virus and lead to more lockdowns. Futures in New York dropped around 3% after closing at the highest in almost 10 months on Friday. Housing sales across seven major cities are expected to fall 47% year-on-year to 1.38 lakh units this year on lower demand because of the covid-19 pandemic, according to property consultant Anarock. New housing supply, too, is likely to fall 46 per cent to 1.28 lakh units in 2020 in seven cities -- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata.

AstraZeneca Pharma stock up by 1.3% on receiving Import and market permission for asthma drug in India. Benralizumab (Fasenra™) is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype in adult patients. The receipt of this permission paves way for the launch of Benralizumab (Fasenra™) in India, subject to the receipt of related statutory approvals and licenses. This is very positive development for the AstraZeneca and this drug launch will help company to increase contribution from domestic business. Indian rupee erased some of early losses but still traded lower at 73.68 per dollar, amid volatility in domestic equities. The unit had opened 18 paise lower at 73.75 per dollar compared with Friday's close of 73.57 per US unit It has been more than a year since India’s banking regulator initiated insolvency proceedings against a broke housing finance company mired in governance controversies. The saga of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd’s (DHFL) insolvency procedure has been intriguing over the past one year. The task to find bidders had looked challenging initially and bankers having exposure to DHFL felt resigned to large haircuts in the beginning. Lenders have already made sizable provisions against the account assuming haircuts in excess of 50%. The plight of thousands of fixed depositors also hung in balance. (Read here) Cement prices in eastern India continued to suffer in December on rising supply. Even as demand has been showing signs of recovery, it is yet to reach a level where this massive supply can be absorbed without hurting prices. Dealers channel check by Nirmal Bang Securities Ltd showed that prices in the region on an average fell to₹274/bag in December from₹296/bag in November. One cement bag weighs 50 kilograms. At an all-India level, prices fell to₹334/bag from₹344/bag during the period. (Read here) Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed India's Future Retail's plea that sought to restrain its partner Amazon.com Inc from interfering in its $3.4 billion asset sale deal with Reliance Industries, Reuters reported. Amazon is locked in a bitter legal dispute with Future Group, which in August sold its retail assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries. The deal breaches agreements made in 2019 by Future, according to the U.S. online retailer. In October, Amazon had won an injunction to halt Future's deal with Reliance from a Singapore arbitrator both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes. Future later said the order was not binding, prompting Amazon to lodge a complaint with India's market regulator. Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators on account of potentially irreparable damage, Justice Mukta Gupta of the Delhi High Court said in the verdict. On Friday, Nifty started the session marginally positive around 13760 but it corrected in the first hour of the trade by more than 100 points from the opening level. However, it found support near the 13650 mark and recovered gradually to end the day near the opening level. Just like the recent past, once again we witnessed upmove in the indices from intraday dip and Nifty managed to end the week at its all time high. However, the banking index has been reluctant to participate during this week and thus has shown some relative underperformance. Although there are no signs of reversal yet on the chart, Nifty is currently trading near an important resistance of 13770 which is the 127% retracement of the previous correction on the weekly charts. Since the momentum readings are in overbought zone and the index is trading near its resistance, there could be some time-wise or a price-wise correction in the near term. As far as levels are concerned, 13650 and 13600 are the important supports whereas 13770-13800 is the important resistance zone. Traders are advised to look to book some profits on their existing longs here and trade with a stock specific approach with a tab on the above mentioned levels. The₹300 crore IPO of Antony Waste Handling Cell opened for subscription today and the issue will close on 21 December. The issue follows the whopping investor response to Burger King and Mrs Bectors Food IPOs earlier this month. Antony Waste Handling Cell is a leading player in solid waste management services in the country. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd has received tentative approval from the US Food & Drug Administration (US FDA) for Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg, the generic version of Pradaxa®1 Capsules, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg, of Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. According to IQVIATM sales data for the 12 month period ended October, Pradaxa® Capsules, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg market2 achieved annual sales of approximately $550.9 million. The Nifty is keeping above the crucial 13700 levels. If we can continue doing that, the markets should be headed to 14000. A strong support lies at the 13500-13600 levels and as long as that holds, the trend of the index remains bullish and traders can utilise any dip to accumulate long positions. Oil fell below $48 a barrel in Asian deals -- after posting a seventh weekly gain -- on concern a mutation of Covid-19 discovered in the U.K. could speed transmission of the virus and lead to more lockdowns. Futures in New York dropped 3% after closing at the highest in almost 10 months on Friday. More than 16 million Britons are now required to stay at home as a full lockdown came into force in London and the southeast of England, with some European countries limiting travel with the U.K. A stronger dollar also reduced the appeal of commodities that are priced in the currency. AstraZeneca Pharma India has received import and market permission in Form CT-20 (Marketing Authorization) from the Drugs Controller General of India for Benralizumab 30mg/mL solution for injection (Fasenra), the company said in a filing to the exchanges. Benralizumab is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype in adult patients. The Centre is likely to invite bids for privatising Shipping Corporation of India this week and buyers will have time till mid February to submit EoIs, an official has said.

    "title": "Nifty at a high, but only 11 stocks are at record levels: A warning or an opportunity?",
    "body": "The Nifty50 hit the magical 15,000-mark early this month and hit a fresh record high of 15,257 on February 9 but only 11 stocks in the index have reached their record highs, so far, in the month. It should not come as a surprise as most stocks are still playing catch up. The 11 stocks that hit their lifetime highs include Adani Ports, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Cipla, HDFC Bank, SBI and UltraTech Cement, data from AceEquity shows Nine stocks like Tata Motors, M&M, L&T, Sun Pharma, ITC and Power Grid Corp are trading at 52-week highs. The rally, which we saw in 2020 and is continuing in 2021, lifted most of the largecaps names in the index but there is plenty of upside still left in many stocks, experts say. “Many stocks are showing that they can lead from here or take rally further such as in FMCG –ITC. In pharma, Lupin and Sun Pharma. In IT, Infosys can lead from here compared to TCS. In banking, SBI. So, there are plenty of stocks in which upside is left and could well turn out to be leaders,” Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman, GCL Securities Limited, told Moneycontrol. “In terms of Nifty target, we see the index heading towards 17,600 in the base case scenario in 2021, and in the best case, it could well hit 18,900 while in the worst-case scenario, the index could be around 15,900,” he added. The Nifty that closed above the psychological mark of 15,000 on February 8 has come a long way after it was launched in April 1996, when it traded at 1,107, with the base year of November 1995 set as 1,000. The Nifty50 took nearly 18 years to reach 7,000, the next 8,000 points come in 6.8 years, Motilal Oswal said in a report. The Nifty 50 Index constituents make up roughly 58 percent of the total India market cap. If we look closely, the sprint to 15k from pandemic lows of 7,600 in March 2020 has taken just 220 days. The sharp recovery has been driven by a global liquidity backdrop, better containment of COVID-19, sharp recovery in corporate earnings and a market-friendly Budget, said the Motilal Oswal report. \"There is plenty of upside still left on the Nifty 50 names. We are looking forward towards 16,308-16,848 to 17,200 for the Nifty50,\" Sacchitanand Uttekar, DVP–Technical (Equity), Tradebulls Securities, told Moneycontrol. Jashan Arora, Director at Master Capital Services, told Moneycontrol that if the Nifty50 move above 15,500, the next target will be in the range of 16,200-16,400 in 2021 Multibaggers: What should investors do? There are 16 Nifty50 stocks that have risen 100-400 percent since April or so far in FY21, data from AceEquity showed. Stocks that more than doubled investors’ wealth include names like Tata Motors, M&M, JSW Steel, Bajaj Finance, HCL Technologies, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, and Cipla. Data suggests that stocks that have more than doubled investors’ wealth since March belong to economy-linked sectors, finance as well as IT. After the recent run-up, investors can look at booking partial profits but the long-term investment argument still remains intact. “Out of the 16 names, one can book profits in the following stocks as they are close to our revised price targets and also trading closer to their peak valuations: Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Auto, Shree Cement and Ultratech Cement,” Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. “We are still bullish on the banking stocks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI. We also like Cipla and Bharti Airtel from a one-year perspective,” he said. Uttekar of Tradebulls Securities said that the stock hitting fresh high with volumes is a good sign, which highlights the willingness of participants to buy quality irrespective of the higher pricing. “Investors should continue to hold these stocks & maintain a trailing stop strategy based on larger degree time frames,” he added. The stock market is more about investing in the future prospect of companies and sectors. The Budget 2021 promised capex in sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, Make in India as well as real estate. Financial services remain the top pick. “Many companies in Nifty50 which have doubled wealth continue to have strong fundamentals and growth prospects. If anyone had invested in these companies in March 2020, they had entered at one of the best times. Despite these companies giving fabulous returns in one year, investors should continue to hold them,” Harshad Chetanwala, Co-Founder- MyWealthGrowth.com told Moneycontrol. “If required one can look at trimming as part of these companies and book profits. At present, it is will be good to hold on with these companies for some more time as a pro-growth Budget after a difficult year, the pace of recovery in economic activities, and reasonable success of COVID vaccination can add more fuel to India’s progress,” he said. Most of the sectors gave positive return in 2020 and with the Budget, which has something or the other for each and every sector, they will not disappoint investors. Hence, picking largecap names which are sectoral leaders will be a safe strategy for investors in 2021, experts say. Given the recent run-up seen in most names, some consolidation cannot be ruled out. But, the long term trend still remains intact. “All the sectors have rallied we can assume that there is not much upside in short term but since the longer-term trend is intact, we may see strong moves post consolidation or corrections in the index,” says Arora of Master Capital Services. Ideally one should focus on booking partial profits in the stocks they hold but it was important to remain invested, he said. \"It is quite probable that India is on the cusp of a multi-year economic expansion cycle. If this pans out, the bull market will sustain and grow stronger. So remain invested in quality stocks in performing sectors,” he said.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty post biggest quarterly gain in 10 years. What analysts say",
    "body": "Reversing intraday gains, Indian markets settled lower today but ended the quarter with strong gains. The Sensex slipped 45 points to 34,915 while NSE Nifty 50 index settled down 0.1% at 10,302, after rising around 0.8% each during the session. The Nifty closed the quarter about up 19.8% and the Sensex 18.5%, registering their best performances since the June quarter of 2009, after hitting a four-year low in March. However, bothSensex and Niftyare still down around 15% for the year as markets grappled with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the country's economy and more recently the border tensions with China. Meanwhile, coronavirus infections continued to surge in India, with total cases rising to 566,840, including 16,893 deaths, as several states prepared to extend their lockdowns.

Miner Coal India slid 1.5% and top lender HDFC Bank ended 1% lower, while gains in Shree Cement and Maruti Suzuki India helped limit losses on the Nifty. Here is what analysts said on today's market action: Manish Hathiramani, Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments \"The markets have been sideways since Friday of last week. We are still unable to trade in a single direction. The Nifty is still in a consolidation phase with low volume trading. We would need to break 10200 or cross 10450 for a directional trade to get activated.\" Vishal Wagh, Research Head, Bonanza Portfolio \"Nifty closed with a flattish note on the last trading session of the June month. It has opened positive inline with the global market but wasn't able to hold the gains. Going forward, major support will be seen around 10195 and Resistance will be 10550.\" Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd. \"Markets settled almost unchanged amid volatility, in continuation to the prevailing consolidation phase. The benchmarks opened with an uptick, taking cues from the global markets but selling pressure erased all the gains in the latter half. Consequently, the Nifty index ended flat at 10,300 levels. On the sector front, a mixed trend was witnessed as on one hand sectors like auto, capital goods and banking ended in green whereas telecom, healthcare and oil & gas ended with losses.\" \"Nifty has been hovering within 10,200-10,400 for the last four sessions and either side break may trigger the next directional move. Meanwhile, limit your trades and use dips to accumulate quality stocks.\" Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director, Choice Broking \"Investors to keep close eye on the coronavirus situation in the country and development related to India-China border tension.Index has been sustain above 21&50 DMA which suggest strength for upside as RSI indicator also trading above the level of 50 with positive crossover which points out strength in the index.

    "title": "Markets week ahead: Will Sensex, Nifty 50 continue their winning spree?",
    "body": "Indian markets broadly witnessed a positive week between October 17-21 despite feeble global peers. Sensex and Nifty 50 surged over 2% each during the week as expectations of an acceleration in demand trends this Diwali along with earnings season lifted overall sentiment. Both Sensex and Nifty 50 continued their winning streak for the sixth consecutive day. Banking stocks outperformed their counterparts. In the coming week, trading in stock markets will be allowed for only 3 days due to a long-leg of holiday on the occasion of Diwali. On Friday, Sensex closed at 59,307.15 up by 104.25 points or 0.18%, while Nifty 50 edged higher by 12.35 points or 0.07% to end at 17,576.30. Heavyweights like Axis Bank,ICICI Bank, HUL, and Kotak Bank were top performers due to their Q2 results. In terms of sectoral indices, BSE Bankex surged by nearly 949 points, while Bank Nifty surged over 684 points on October 21. Meanwhile, therupeeedged higher against the US dollar amidst firmness in domestic equities and a sustained surge in treasury yields coupled with RBI's intervention. After cracking 83-mark, the rupee closed at 82.6750 per dollar on Friday. In the past six weeks, the domestic currency dropped by around 4% against the greenback. On the other hand, after holding a bearish appetite for equities,FIIsturned into net buyers in the last two trading sessions of this week with October 20 witnessing the most buying. On October 21, FIIs pumped in₹438.89 crore in the equities, while on October 20 -- the investment was to the tune of₹1,864.79 crore. From October 17-19, FIIs selling in the equities was around₹979.34 crore. From last week, Sensex rose by over 1,387 points or 2.4%, while Nifty 50 soared by nearly 391 points or 2.3% respectively in the week between October 17-21. Compared to last week, the BSE-listed firms' market cap jumped more than₹4.13 lakh crore in the week ending October 21, 2022, to nearly₹274.42 lakh crore. The market cap was around₹270.29 lakh crore by end of October 14 last week. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, \"Despite global weaknesses, domestic sentiment was positive ahead of Diwali and the market showed its resilience, supported by a good start to the earnings season. The benchmark indices have been rising for the last six sessions, aided by stock-specific momentum in IT, banks, and FMCG. The rise in credit growth to a 10 year high of 17.94% YoY as of October added colour to the bank nifty with a gain of 3.8%, while PSU banks gained by 11% during the week.\" Trading in equities, derivatives, commodities and other securities will be shut on October 24 due to Lakshi Pujan (main Diwali) and on October 26 due to the Diwali Balipratipada celebration. Thereby, trading will be allowed only on October 25, 27, and 28. However, markets will open for an hour on October 24 from 6.15 pm to 7.15 pm as part ofMuhurat trading. According to Nair, some profit booking was also seen towards the end of the week as domestic investors maintained their cautious stance ahead of the truncated week. On the global front, a rise in UK inflation to a 40-year high of 10.1% in September added to fears of more aggressive monetary policy by the central bank. As there are no major triggers for the next week, the market direction will be based on global sentiment and the earnings season. Further, Mitul Shah - Head of Research at Reliance Securities said, “The Indian rupee breached the 83 per dollar mark for the very first time, on growing demand of dollars from fuel companies and a widening current account deficit. A rising dollar and strengthening US bond yields only contributed to the weakness. The Indian rupee has fallen ~12% against the dollar so far this year. The market fear that more rate hikes by the US Fed could again harden US Treasury yields which could further weaken the rupee.” Also, Shah said, \"The 2QFY23 earning season so far witnessed healthy revenue growth but higher inflationary pressure took toll on profitability. So far 120/BSE500 companies' revenue grew by 23% YoY, EBITDA increased by 15% YoY while PAT was largely flat on YoY basis.\" Shah added, \"Inflation continues to remain sticky, both, in the domestic and the US economy. India's growth remains strong and expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world, while global recession and downgrading of growth persisted for major economies. The market is looking at US Fed monetary policy meeting scheduled for 2nd November. Commentary on festive demand, inflation outlook and rate hike will be keenly watched in the near term.\" Some of the major Q2 earnings to watch in the week of October 24-28 are -- Dabur, Tata Chemicals, Indus Tower, SBI Card, REC, and PNB Housing Finance among others.

We believe that a rapid and widespread progress of the monsoon, albeit with delay, should keep investors interested in the markets in the short term,\" he said. While the Sensex also hit a fresh record high today, it had already achieved the milestone twice last week. In addition, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 were also closing in on their record highs. All the sectoral indices were trading in positive territory, reflecting the positive sentiments on Dalal Street. Nifty Metal was leading the pack, with gains of over 1 per cent. The top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Titan, JSW Steel and Bajaj Finance. On the other hand, the top losers were HDFC Life, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra and ONGC. The record rally in the domestic benchmark indices, including the Nifty 50, has been driven by strong domestic growth, easing inflation, strong foreign inflows, and robust corporate earnings. Analysts remain optimistic about domestic stock markets, both from an economic and technical point of view.",

    "body": "Sensex, Nifty rise:Indian stock market indices surged to new highs, with the Nifty 50 reaching a record level of 19,201.70 and the S&P BSE Sensex settling at a fresh peak of 64,718.56. Due to the rally in equities, the market capitalisation (mcap) of BSE-listed companies jumped to₹295.72 lakh crore, setting a lifetime high. (Sensex, Nifty all updates) The benchmark had its strongest week in over 11 months, and advances extended for the fourth month in a row. But what is fuelling the share markets' rise? Here are some reasons: One of the major reasons for India's benchmark indices reaching new record highs is due to the boost in the performance of information technology (IT) stocks. Twelve of the 13 major sector indices logged gains, with the IT index rising over 2% each. Infosys jumped over 3%. The IT industry heavily relies on clients from the United States, so the positive release of strong economic data from the world's largest economy has eased concerns about a slowdown and improved the overall market sentiment. US' favourable economic indicators like increased first-quarter GDP, decreased jobless claims, and successful stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve have reduced economy slowdown worries, boosting the markets. The automotive sector reached new record highs, with a rise of over 2%. Auto stocks such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp, and Maruti Suzuki emerged as top gainers among the Nifty 50 companies, ahead of the release of June sales data. Strong foreign inflows, controlled inflation, and consistent growth in corporate earnings have further boosted confidence in the Indian equities market. Positive macroeconomic fundamentals have attracted inflows totalling more than $3.5 billion. This has also helped the rupee strengthen, the strongest since January, as it closed the day at 82.0375 per dollar, up from 82.0550 the previous session.",

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty touch record high but did they outshine gold in H-1CY23?",
    "body": "Nifty vs Sensex vs gold:After giving zero return in first two months of the current year (CY) 2023, key benchmark indices of theIndian stock market— NSE Nifty andBSESensex — witnessed strong rally in last four months that helped both indices to touch record high on the last session of CY2023. In first six months of CY23, Nifty has delivered 5.83 per cent return whereas 30-stock index Sensex surged to the tune of 6.32 per cent in this time. However, gold is not a laggard in terms of giving return to its long term investors. In January to June 2023 time, gold has given 5.73 per cent return to its investors. Speaking on the return given by Sensex, Nifty and gold in first six months of 2023, Anuj Gupta, Vice President — research atIIFL Securitiessaid, \"BothNiftyand Sensex ended lower in first two months due to concerns of economic slowdown in the US and other strong economies. In this period, we saw gold emerging as a haven for investors as they were relocating their money from equity and other asset class to gold and bonds. But, ease in pressure on the US economy and US Fed's interest rate pause led to trend reversal in Indian markets. However, gold remained investors' favorite till end of May 2023. However, profit booking had triggered in mid of May.\" On how gold remained in reckoning despite stock market rally in India, Sugandha Sachdeva, Executive Director & Chief Strategist at Acme Investment Advisors said, \"Even though Nifty and Sensex touched record high during last session of H1-CY23, gold has also been a strong performer in the first half of 2023, with prices up around 5.73 per cent year-to-date. Gold prices have remained buoyant amid the concerns surrounding the banking crisis in the US, hopes of an interest rate cut by the US Fed towards the end of the year, weakness in the greenback, robust central banks buying in the Q1 CY23, concerns of a slowdown in growth momentum and positive globalgold ETFflows of around $1bln till May 2023. However, prices have corrected since the second half of May amid a slew of headwinds-concerns of US debt ceiling subsiding, receding inflationary pressures, sizeable net selling by central banks’ in April, and the rebound in the dollar index from multi-month lows at the expense of gold.\" \"The major turnaround in Nifty and Sensex took place in the month of April as both DIIs and FIIs became net buyers had helped Nifty register around 4.1 per cent rise. This rise in key benchmark indices in the month of April triggered buying interest in broad markets as small-cap and mid-cap indices were the first to touch life-time highs. After the robust rebound, Nifty and Sensex extended this rally in May and June as well. Nifty logged 2.60 per cent return in the month of May while in June 2023, 50-stock index registered 3.50 per cent rise,\" said Anuj Gupta of IIFL Securities. On factors that led to trend reversal on Dalal Street, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"The Nifty 50 index and Sensex witnessed a scorching rally and surged to new all-time highs in the first half of 2023. This rally has been driven by a number of factors, including robust foreign investor flows, upbeat US economic data, receding inflationary pressures, subdued crude oil prices, steady corporate earnings, and a revival of the monsoon. FIIs have pumped around $11 billion into the Indian stock market in the past four months. Further, broad-based participation from almost all sectors has contributed to the Nifty's roaring upsurge.\" Giving credit toHDFC BankHDFC merger for the last minute push in Indian markets ahead of the end of first half of 2023, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"Markets also received a nudge from the optimism surrounding the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger. This merger would create the world's fourth-largest bank bymarket capitalization. The merger is seen as a positive sign for the Indian economy, as it would create a stronger and more efficient financial institution,\" adding, \"Furthermore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the US has also brought about exuberance in the markets. His visit is likely to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries, and as a slew of strategic deals were signed, investor sentiment improved back home.\" On which asset class may outperform others in the next half of 2023, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"It would be difficult to assess, which asset class will outperform in the second half of the year. Ultimately, the performance of both asset classes will depend on several factors, including the global economic outlook, interest rates trajectory, and geopolitical developments.\" Disclaimer:The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

    "body": "Stock Market Today, Share Market Updates:The topline equity indices recovered theirprevious session’s lossesand ended nearly 3 per cent higher on Friday taking cues from their global peers which rose after China cut a key lending benchmark to support a slowing economy.

Both the indices had opened over 1.5 per cent higher earlier in the day and surged more as the session progressed with the Sensex touching an intraday high of 54,396.43 and the broader Nifty hitting 16,283.05. All the Sensex stocks ended higher on Friday with the top gainers being Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Reliance Industries (RIL),Nestle India,Tata Steel, Larsen & Toubro (L&T),IndusIndBank, Axis Bank, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC).

The volatility index or India VIX on NSE declined 5.93 per cent to 23.10. Commenting on the market rally on Friday, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “The market displayed a confident yet calm rally throughout the day, supported by fortified global markets, especially the Asian market. The Chinese Central bank cut a key interest rate to support growth, injecting optimism into emerging markets. With concerns over an economic slowdown and rate hikes across the globe, investors will continue to invest with caution. Value stocks should do well during this consolidation period.” Shares rebounded on Friday after China cut a key lending benchmark to support its economy, though a global equities gauge remained set for its longest weekly losing streak on record amid investor worries about slowing growth and highinflation. At 0833 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 1.2 per cent and set for its first daily gain in three. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, rose 0.5 per cent but for the week was still shedding 1 per cent and on track for its seventh consecutive weekly decline, its longest losing streak since its inception in 2001. The gains in Europe and Asia came after a late Thursday rally on Wall Street petered out, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.75 per cent, the S&P 500 0.58 per cent lower and the Nasdaq Composite off by 0.26 per cent. -global market input from Reuters Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed.

    "body": "Boom to gloom: India middle-class jitters amid trillion-dollar market rout 6 March 2025 Share Save Soutik Biswas and Nikhil Inamdar BBC News Share Save BBC Rajesh Kumar pulled out the bulk of his bank savings and and shifted to the stock market Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds. With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five. But the tide has turned. For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge. India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third. \"For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,\" Mr Kumar says. Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; £16,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. \"Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,\" he says. His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution. The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media \"finfluencers\" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike. Tarun Sircar moved his retirement fund to the stock market last year before the crash Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor. When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market. \"I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!\" For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. \"I'm both ignorant and confident,\" he says with wry candour. \"Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype.\" Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. \"The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,\" he says. In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. \"When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed.\" Mr Sircar lives in hope. \"My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green.\" Reuters One in five Indian households have put their savings in the stock market There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic. Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market. \"I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,\" he says. Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in . \"This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,\" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. \"Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next.\" Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets. On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. \"The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,\" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. \"Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?\" Getty Images Monika Halan says new investors must learn to manage expectations This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses. \"In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,\" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst. \"Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances.\" Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. \"We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event.\" But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs. Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite. Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious. In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors. \"This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,\" says Ms Halan. \"If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.\" Follow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube, X and Facebook . Asia Stock markets Middle classes India",

    "body": "India stocks see biggest fall for over four years 4 June 2024 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have to rely more on allies in forming a government Indian stocks have fallen sharply after vote counting in the country's general election indicated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party might not be able to form a majority government. The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 share index closed down nearly 6%, its steepest fall since India's first Covid lockdowns in March 2020. Early results suggest Mr Modi's political party may need to rely on allies and form a coalition government. That could lead to uncertainty over economic policies, some analysts said. The NSE Nifty 50, which comprises stocks in various big companies, had plunged 8.5% at one point but ended the day down 5.9% at 21,884.5 points. The S&P BSE Sensex also fell sharply, closing 5.7% lower at 72,079.05. The rupee slid 0.5% against the US dollar, its biggest fall in 16 months. More than half the votes have been counted in India's general election, and Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks unlikely to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament. It may have to rely on allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to form the next government. Analysts suggest that could lead to some uncertainty over economic policies, such as a push for investment, which has been one of the mainstays of the Modi government's rule. \"The key question is whether BJP can retain single-party majority,\" Ken Peng, head of investment strategy, Asia, at Citi Global Wealth, told Reuters. \"If not, then would its coalition be able to deliver economic development, particularly infrastructure?\" Puneet Sharma, chief executive and fund manager at Whitespace Alpha, told Reuters that if the new government is dependent on coalition partners it \"may shift its focus\" to put more emphasis on welfare \"rather than concentrating on reforms during the July budget\". The Hindu nationalist BJP won majorities in 2014 and 2019. Markets had soared on Monday after exit polls over the weekend had suggested Mr Modi and the BJP would gain a significant victory. But it now looks as though the BJP will fall short of achieving a majority by itself. Market analyst Fiona Cincotta told the BBC key Indian stock indexes had been \"really battered\". She added that there had been some \"very big fallers\" in individual stocks, including oil and gas firm Reliance Industries, and Bank of India. Stock markets",

What foreign investors say India's government bonds are expected to remain attractive to foreign investors, despite concerns over potential policy shifts following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's narrower-than-expected victory margin in the recent elections. Although the unexpected election outcome caused a dip in stocks, bonds, and the rupee due to fears of increased populist spending and a slowdown in reforms, fund managers remain optimistic about the bond market.Kenneth Akintewe, head of Asian sovereign debt at abrdn, views the initial response of higher yields and currency weakness as \"an attractive opportunity to add risk.\" He believes that the positive outlook for bonds remains largely unaffected by the election results, particularly given the stronger-than-expected fiscal starting point.Adarsh Sinha, co-head of Asia FX & rates strategy at Bank of America, questions the likelihood of a surge in populist spending immediately after the elections. \"For the government, what would be the incentive to splurge after the election in the near term?\" Sinha suggests that expectations of such spending may be misplaced. (Reuters) The medium-term growth story in India does not change, as strong cycles that have begun are likely to support themselves. The extent and duration of the cycle will become clearer once the new government is sworn in as we look at the 100-day agenda. We retain our modest market returns view for this year with the year-end (Dec 24) target set at 23,500 (remains unchanged).

He says that long-term investors should maintain their belief in India's solid economic fundamentals and expect the market benchmarks to double in the next 5-6 years. The narrative around ‘Make in India’ is not expected to change but the dynamics may be different as the new reality of the NDA coalition government plays out. However, the pace of execution in policies may slow down a bit so the expectations from infrastructure and manufacturing stocks may be toned down. Stock Market Today Live Updates: BSE Sensex Stocks At 1:03 PM Stock Market Today Live Updates: Short-term volatility likely Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities, anticipates that the markets will continue to experience short-term volatility, despite the historic third consecutive victory of the NDA-led BJP government. Given the current circumstances, it is recommended that investors and traders exercise caution and allow the markets to find stability following the unexpected election results. Defensive sectors such as FMCG, Telecom, and Pharma, which are less influenced by government policies, may be a prudent focus for market participants, says Tapse.The upcoming budget presentation and the release of quarterly earnings reports are expected to be significant events that could impact market trends. There is concern regarding the potential repositioning of FIIs and the resilience of DII investments in the near term. From a technical perspective, the market's upside potential appears limited in the short term, while the downside may unfold gradually. The crucial level to monitor is the 21,000 mark; a close below this psychological threshold could trigger further selling pressure, potentially pushing the market down to test the 20,200 level, he was quoted as saying by ET.

Stock Market Today Live Updates: How New Government Will Face Key Policy Issues Geopolitical uncertainties and the global economic situation may require acceleration of reforms. But with a coalition govt at the Centre, it may not be easy as some issues, such as privatisation and a relook at GST, need consensus. TOI lists top areas of focus:GST revamp: Five-slab GST rate structure may not be reviewed immediately as it may require merging the 12% and 18% slabs, necessitating an increase in levies on goods and services that move into the higher bracket. That's an issue on which political consensus may not be easy.Public Finances: Privatisation is likely to be put on a back-burner for some time. While RBI's mega dividend of Rs 2.1L crore and robust GST revenues will keep Centre's finances in good shape, the Centre may have to go slow on cleaning up the subsidy regime further, although greater use of technology to plug leakages is something that won't change.Investment push: After hitting a high of $85 billion in 2021-22, the annual inflow of foreign direct investments has fallen for two consecutive years, touching $71 billion in 2023-24. Govt is expected to make the investment regime more attractive in several sectors, including electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.Food prices: Although overall inflation has moderated (see chart below), food prices remain both volatile and high. Govt may take steps to weatherproof prices and shield it from climate-induced shocks such as heatwaves and floods.Agriculture: The latest GDP data indicates a relative stagnation in the farm sector. Reforms focusing on irrigation and use of Al to raise productivity are expected. Election results point to the challenging but imminent need to raise farmers' income.Exports & PLI: The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has helped push exports of smartphones and other products but there have been demands to extend it to more sectors, such as toys and footwear. Expect fine-tuning of PLI to focus more sharply on companies and sectors willing to shift out of China for export production.Regulatory clarity: Before the poll dates were announced, several new economic legislations were in the works. A better regulation of cryptocurrencies, Al, data protection is under consideration.Maintaining growth: Most economists do not expect 2024-25 GDP growth to be a repeat of 8.2% growth in 2023-24. But ensuring a growth rate of even 7% in the current global economic environment won't be easy. Among the steps expected are a road map for energy transition and a push for infra investments. Economic ministries have made action plans with specific targets for 2030 and 2047. A ministry-wise action plan could be unveiled, if there is a consensus in the new govt.

Nifty50 was at 22,040.15, up 156 points or 0.71%. Stock Market Today Live Updates: How PSU stocks reacted on June 4 Stock market crash: The stock market experienced a significant downturn on Tuesday, with public sector enterprises (PSUs) bearing the brunt of the losses. Investors expressed concerns about the future prospects of these companies following the Bharatiya Janata Party's failure to secure a decisive majority in the general elections. The market had anticipated that a strong BJP-led government would be crucial for further gains in PSU stocks. However, the election outcome has raised doubts about the government's ability to effectively revive state-owned companies during its third term.The BSE's PSU index suffered its worst single-day losses, plummeting by 15.7%. Several PSU stocks were hit particularly hard, with Power financier REC leading the pack with a 24% slump. Other notable losers included Power Finance Corporation, Container Corporation of India, Bharat Electronics, BHEL, and SAIL, all of which saw their stock prices drop between 18-22%. The majority of PSU stocks experienced declines exceeding 10% during the trading session. The market capitalisation of PSUs collectively lost ₹10.62 lakh crore in a single day.Vinit Sambre, Head Equities at DSP Mutual Fund, commented on the market reaction, saying, \"Over the last 18 months, the valuation gap between the PSU and their private counterparts had been narrowing as a result of massive rerating fuelled by optimism surrounding the BJP's development agenda. However, the unexpected election result has affected this narrative, leading to a swift unwinding of the positive sentiment that had been built up.\" Stock Market Today Live Updates: Pace of reforms to not slow down? Morgan Stanley's Riddham Desai has shared his insights on the recent election verdict and its potential impact on the Indian equity markets. According to Desai, the firm's medium to long-term views remain unchanged despite the outcome of the elections.He expects both realized and implied volatility to decrease in the coming days, suggesting a more stable market environment. However, Desai points out that the equity markets have not yet priced in the possibility of \"unresolvable disagreements within the NDA coalition,\" which could potentially lead to some uncertainty.Despite this, Desai believes that the pace of reforms is unlikely to slow down following the election results. He also expresses confidence that the government will continue to prioritize macro stability as the foundation of its economic policy, rather than sacrificing it for short-term gains. Stock Market Today Live Updates: ‘Markets will take time to recover’ According to Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, the unexpected election outcomes will require some time for the market to digest. Although stability is expected to be restored in the near future, fluctuations will persist until there is transparency regarding the cabinet and crucial portfolios. In the short term, a significant market recovery is improbable, but sector-specific preferences may shift. Industries such as FMCG, healthcare, and IT will gain increasing favor, while momentum plays will decelerate, he said.The sharp market correction has one advantage: it has slightly reduced the excessive valuations, which will encourage institutional buying once the cabinet's formation and composition are clarified.Investors can begin accumulating high-quality largecaps in sectors such as IT, financials, autos, and capital goods, he says. Stock Market Today Live Updates: Sensex, Nifty pare initial gains Stock market today: After rising over 650 points, Indian markets pared initial gains on Wednesday. At 9:49 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 72,142.00, up 63 points or 0.087%. Nifty50 was at 21,906.35, down 22 points or 0.100%. Sectors (PSUs and nonPSUs) that previously enjoyed inflated valuations due to expectations of strong reform-driven growth may experience some downward pressure on valuations Stock Market Today Live Updates: What’s the road ahead for investors? Mahesh Nandurkar from Jefferies shares his insights on the potential outcome of the elections and its impact on various sectors. He maintains that the most likely scenario is a coalition government with Narendra Modi at the helm.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the elections, Nandurkar remains optimistic about the housing-led capital expenditure cycle. He believes that any extreme market reactions to the election results could present a lucrative buying opportunity for investors, according to an ET report.According to Nandurkar, large-cap stocks that have underperformed in the recent past offer the most attractive risk-reward ratio. He particularly favors private banks, consumer staples, and automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). However, he has reduced his overweight stance on real estate, industrials, and public sector undertakings (PSUs).

Stock Market Today Live Updates: Check out the stocks in news today Stock market crash: The domestic markets experienced a significant intraday decline yesterday, the largest in over four years, as the election results indicated the NDA's return to power but with a reduced majority. Today's trading session will focus on various companies, including Tata Motors, Wipro, RIL, SJVN, NTPC, and Canara Bank, due to recent developments.SJVNanticipates its 900 MW Arun-3 hydro-electric project in Nepal, currently under construction, to commence power generation from the following year, as approximately 75% of the work has been completed.PSU stockswill remain in the spotlight today following a significant sell-off on Monday, which was triggered by the NDA securing a lower-than-expected majority in the Lok Sabha elections.Tata Motors' board has given the green light to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary, proposed to be named TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCVL), to manage its commercial vehicles business.RIL, a major constituent of the Nifty50 index, will be closely watched today after the company's investors lost around Rs 1.27 lakh crore on Tuesday.Wiprohas partnered with Zscaler to introduce \"Wipro Cyber X-Ray,\" an AI-assisted decision support platform.Infosyshas announced a collaboration with Nihon Chouzai (TSE) to expand healthcare access in Japan by enhancing online medication guidance services.NTPCis reportedly planning to venture into the nuclear power sector by establishing a 10 GW capacity with an investment of Rs 1.5 lakh crore over a 10-year period.Canara Bankhas reportedly initiated the process of seeking regulatory approval to convert its software services subsidiary into a non-banking finance company. We are of the view that the current market texture is extremely volatile and uncertain; hence, it is advisable that traders should remain cautious for next few trading sessions Stock Market Today Live Updates: What should investors do? Stock Market Today Live Updates: What’s happening in global markets? On Tuesday, U.S. stocks experienced a modest increase following the publication of weaker-than-expected labor market data. This information strengthened the notion that the Federal Reserve may soon lower interest rates. The data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. job openings in April fell to the lowest level in more than three years, suggesting a softening of labor market conditions. This development is consistent with the anticipated Fed rate cut in the near term. As a result, U.S. Treasury yields declined after the report's release.In early Asian trading on Wednesday, oil prices continued to slide slightly from the previous session after an industry report indicated increases in U.S. crude and fuel stockpiles. This news further exacerbated concerns regarding demand growth. Brent crude futures fell 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $77.38 a barrel by 0005 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 18 cents, or 0.3%, to $73.07 a barrel. Stock Market Today Live Updates: What GIFT Nifty signals Gift Nifty (formerly SGX Nifty) indicates a positive openingNifty futures on the Gift Nifty rose by 103 points, or 0.47%, to trade at 22,050 The markets are pricing the risk associated with this scenario, and the potential impact of a shift toward socialist policies by the government, thus leading to a sell-off, We would like to see the incoming govt continue to create a favourable environment for four growth factors: increased foreign direct investments into the country, private capex, continuation of govt capex and better infrastructure, both social and physical Stock Market Today Live Updates: Budget to be keenly watched Investment professionals hold the view that capital expenditure, undertaken by both the government and private enterprises, plays a crucial role in driving economic growth. They emphasize the importance of private sector investment, which has been significantly lacking in recent years, and stress that it should either supplement or complement the government's capital expenditure efforts.Given India's favorable macroeconomic fundamentals, fund managers believe that any positive developments on the global stage could provide additional support to the domestic economy. These potential tailwinds include improving macroeconomic conditions in China and interest rate reductions in the United States.The upcoming Budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025 is expected to be a key determinant of the future trajectory of the Indian economy and financial markets. Market participants will closely monitor the budget announcements and their potential impact on various sectors and overall economic growth prospects. Stock Market Today Live Updates: Development agenda to continue? Stock market crash: According to Vinit Sambre, head (equities), DSP Mutual Fund, “There is a bit of uncertainty as investors are concerned about the slowdown of reforms that had been initiated under the (outgoing) BJP-led govt. This has triggered a correction in the markets as investors reassess the outlook under the new political landscape. We would like to believe that the development agenda that spurred the performance of equity is likely to persist, irrespective of the party in power.” The election result is likely to lead to a more balanced market. Risk-reward in large-caps and underperforming sectors like banking and consumer appear more favourable. There is likely to be greater scrutiny and valuation discipline in the performing sectors like capital goods, power, defence and manufacturing Stock Market Today Live Updates: Raging bull market to be reined in? Stock market live updates: Fund managers in India are hopeful that the new government will maintain the current momentum of economic reforms and policies that support the industry. They anticipate that the BJP-led alliance, despite having a reduced mandate, will persist with the initiatives and projects initiated by the previous government. This sentiment prevails even amidst the apprehension that gripped investors following the announcement of the Lok Sabha election results on Tuesday.Furthermore, financial experts believe that the election outcome, which is seen as a setback for the ruling alliance but a significant boost for the opposition, has the potential to temper the surging bull market in India and bring valuations to a more reasonable level. Most believe that even though the BJP-led alliance now has a depleted mandate, it would continue the works and projects launched under the outgoing govt. Stock Market Today Live Updates: Adani stocks take a severe beating Stock market crash: The stock prices of all 11 Adani Group companies plummeted on Tuesday, resulting in a staggering loss of Rs 3.6 lakh crore for investors. The crash was attributed to the reduced mandate for the BJP-led NDA coalition. Since Prime Minister Modi took office in May 2014, opposition parties have claimed that the Adani Group has gained the most. Investors speculate that a weakened NDA mandate could cause the group to lose its competitive edge. Additionally, the group would face increased scrutiny from a more powerful opposition.According to dealers, these factors contributed to the decline of Adani Group stocks in Tuesday's crashing market. BSE data revealed that the group's combined market capitalization dropped from Rs 19.4 lakh crore on Monday to Rs 15.8 lakh crore as stock prices of Adani Group companies plunged during the day.The group's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, led the decline with a 19% crash, eroding its market cap by Rs 80,416 crore. Adani Ports, which will soon join the sensex, lost nearly Rs 72,800 crore, or a fifth of its market value, bringing its current level to Rs 2.7 lakh crore. Other group companies also suffered significant losses, with Adani Green Energy losing nearly Rs 62,000 crore and Adani Power losing about Rs 58,300 crore in market value. Stock Market Today Live Updates: What happens to IPO launches? India has secured the second position in the global IPO market, raising $4 billion in the current year. With the NDA expected to form the next government, the IPO boom is likely to continue throughout 2024 due to anticipated policy stability. Although the amount raised by India is 45% lower than the total collected in 2023, according to LSEG data, it surpasses China ($3 billion) and Saudi Arabia ($2.1 billion). India's IPO proceeds also exceed the combined amount raised in Turkey, Hong Kong, and South Korea. The US remains the top IPO market, having raised $14 billion so far in 2024, as per LSEG. India has climbed from the 11th position in 2019 to the third place globally in terms of IPO proceeds, following the US and China in 2023.Between January and the present, India has witnessed 113 IPOs. Mahavir Lunawat, MD at investment bank Pantomath Capital Advisors, said, \"Amidst general elections, the primary market remained vibrant with the solid response to certain IPOs like Awfis Space Solutions. Confidence can be gauged by these offerings that have been launched amidst elections... Looking ahead, the market is set to witness a flurry of IPOs, from new-age business as well as from conventional business segments.\"Several prominent companies, including Hyundai Motor India, Tata Capital, Ola Electric Mobility, Swiggy, and NSDL, are planning to launch their IPOs in the near future. Stock Market Today Live Updates: ‘Investors to focus on government formation’ According to UBS, “After a weak political outcome, we believe investors will focus on govt formation and the choice of prime ministerial candidate considering the BJP does not have a simple majority of its own.” The other focus areas would be “policy choices to support growth vis-a-vis ensuring macro stability, and the reform narrative”.UBS analysts said they would watch out for upcoming union budget announcements, implementation of labour laws and the next set of reforms in land and capital.“This was not an election outcome the market valuations were set up for. Indian valuations have been expensive for pretty ordinary corporate earnings growth/outlook. One of the arguments behind India’s rich valuations has been the political stability/policy certainty afforded by a strong govt. Some of those assumptions could now come under question,” the report by UBS said. Stock Market Today Live Updates: What will be the market reaction - immediate and long-term? Stock market live updates: According to Pradeep Gupta, Co-founder & Vice-chairman, Anand Rathi Group, the Indian stock markets experienced significant volatility in response to the 2024 Lok Sabha election results with broader indices, Nifty 50 closing the day at -5.93%, with the lowest of the day touching -8.19%. Here are the key reactions and insights based on recent market movements and expert analyses by Anand Rathi.•Immediate Market Reaction:The markets saw heightened volatility due to the uncertainty surrounding the election outcomes mainly due to the gap between the exit polls and the actual results declared today. The pre-election rally witnessed yesterday, driven by expectations of a BJP victory, had already been factored into market prices. Till the question of the continuity of the current government was at an unsure position, the markets continued with heightened volatility in the short term period.•Long-Term Outlook:Historical data suggests that despite initial volatility, markets tend to recover and even thrive in the longer term. For instance, even after the 2014 and 2019 elections, the Indian stock market saw significant gains in the months following the election results. Investors are advised to focus on long-term strategies, such as maintaining a diversified portfolio and avoiding panic selling. Strong fundamentals and resilience against political changes are crucial for navigating market volatility.•Sectoral Impact:Sectors like infrastructure, defence, and capital goods are expected to benefit from policy continuity and government focus on development projects.Large-cap stocks are preferred for their stability and resilience against economic fluctuations. In summary, while the immediate market reaction to the election results has been volatile, the overall long-term outlook remains positive, particularly if policy continuity is maintained. Investors are encouraged to stay informed, focus on fundamentals, and be prepared for short-term fluctuations. NITISH AND NAIDU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFULL AND SHOULD NOT ALIGN WITH INDI GROUP AS THEY HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCES IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE O... Sensex will cross 100000 very soon.. The trends yesterday panicked the investors but now they have the solace that BJP will form the alliance government and Ada-Amba will continue to flou...",

    "title": "Nifty 50 outlook: 4 key reasons why Indian stock market may fall 5-10%; Emkay lists 5 stocks to avoid",
    "body": "Nifty 50 outlook: Indian stock market benchmarks may see a significant correction of 5-10 per cent in the near term, while the mid and small-cap segments may suffer more. However, the long-term prospects of the Indian stock market remain positive and a meaningful correction could be an opportunity to buy stocks, according to brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services. \"We see the risk of an imminent 5-10 per cent correction in the headline indices, with bigger drawdowns inSMID(small and midcap) stocks. We remain constructive on India from a longer-term (more than 1one year) perspective and would use a meaningful correction to increase exposure to the market,\" said Emkay. The brokerage firm pointed out that the market'svaluationis stretched, and most variables are already priced. The Q1FY25 earnings are expected to remain tepid, and rate cuts in the US may start only at the end of the year. After a 1.1 per cent fall in the previous session, market benchmark Nifty 50 opened 0.3 per cent lower at 24,445.75 on Monday, July 22, and slipped further by 0.7 per cent to a level of 24,362.30. However, the index reversed losses and moved up soon, thanks to support from select heavyweights such asHDFC BankandInfosys. Around 11 am, the index traded 0.2 per cent up at 24,575. Emkay Global highlighted the following four key reasons why the Indian stock market could see a correction: Emkay expects policy continuity in the Budget. It said fiscal deficit should be maintained at about 5-5.1 per cent of GDP, with a focus on capital expenditure (capex) over revenue expenditure (revex). \"We see little risk of a pivot to increased welfare spending, despite the pressures of a relatively adverse election result and the loss of absolute majority for the BJP. The₹2.1 lakh crore windfall from the RBI dividend gives the government increased degrees of freedom on both, pursuing fiscal prudence and pushing capex,\" said Emkay. \"We would, however, watch for forward movement on privatization (unlikely) and asset monetisation (more likely). There is an outlier probability of negative changes in the capital gains regime, which could trigger a strong sell-off and prolonged sideways market after that,\" Emkay said. The brokerage firm emphasized that the market seems complacent about the changed political landscape, posing a risk if the upcoming assembly elections yield unexpected results. \"Though the government remains stable, there could be adverse events (like a possible NDA defeat in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections) that could exacerbate uncertainty,\" said Emkay. Emkay observed that the growth in FY24 PAT (profit after tax) was led by a 275bps improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins (BSE-500, excluding financials). This is now in the base. \"For financials, upward normalisation of credit costs could dampen PAT growth. This is partly reflected in the FY25 Nifty EPS (earning per share) growth slowing to 16.5 per cent (FY24: 18.2 per cent). While the forecasts have little downside risk, upgrade potential also looks dim,\" said Emkay. \"A weak Q1 owing to stretched valuations and a strong lead-up stock-price rally could trigger a correction. The manufacturing sector, overall, is a little more exposed to this risk than the services sector. Tech would be most immune from this trend,\" said Emkay. Emkay expects the tight monetary conditions to persist till end-2024. \"Our base case is that the Fed starts cutting rates in Q4CY25, with significant risks of further delay. The RBI is likely to be in lockstep (by choice if not by necessity), with little chance of a rate cut until inflation is firmly in the comfort zone of nearly 4 per cent,\" said Emkay. \"Domestic liquidity conditions have eased somewhat, but we expect active RBI interventions to ensure no rate cut by stealth. Therefore, the rally in banks could fizzle out as expectations of easier monetary conditions ease. For investors wishing to position themselves ahead of the year-end rate cuts, the best sectors would be autos, real estate, and technology – this, however, could take more than six months to fructify,\" Emkay said. Emkay underscored that the post-election rally has shot up the valuations of the Indian stock market. \"The Nifty, at 21.4 times one-year forward PE, is 10 per cent above the five-year historic mean. Valuations for the NSE Midcap 150 (42 times trailing PE) and NSE smallcap 250 (31 times trailing PE) are also 52.5 per cent and 35.5 per cent, respectively, above the five-year averages. Even accounting for the strong growth outlook, we see these valuations having some front-ended future returns and setting up the market for a one-time correction,\" said Emkay. \"Only meaningful upgrades in forward estimates could support such elevated multiples, and we do not see that in the next one to two quarters,\" Emkay said. HDFC Bank, SBI Cards, PI Industries, Eicher Motors and L&T Technology Services are the stocks in the \"key avoids\" list of the brokerage firm. Emkay is underweight on financials and said even as the market adjusts to new growth or ROE (return on equity) reality, there is scope for derating in HDFC Bank and SBI Cards \"We initiate a key avoids list. Our underweight financials are reflected via HDFC Bank and SBI Cards, as we see derating in both stocks even as the market adjusts to a new growth/ROE reality,\" said Emkay. The brokerage firm has added Eicher to the list as it prefers Hero and TVS, given product positioning and valuations. Emaky said L&T Technology Services, at 40 times PE, is at an unwarranted premium to large-cap IT services names, especially with a looming weak FY25 (5 per cent EPS grwoth). PI Industries is the fifth stock: the sub-5 per cent EPS growth for FY25 and FY26 is not yet reflected in the 33 times PE ratio. Emkay's model portfolio includes TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp, Dabur, HUL, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, UltraTech Cement and IndiGo among the top stocks to buy. Suprajit Engineering, Honasa Consumer and Senco Gold are among Emkay's top recommendations from the small and midcap segments.

Asia continues to drive growth in the global futures and options industry, with Asian trading volumes breaking 40 billion lots in a single quarter for the first time. FOW Data shows Asian exchanges traded 40.7 billion contracts in the three months to the end of June, which was up 106% from the second quarter of last year and 4% higher than the first three months of 2024. June was the second busiest month on record for Asian futures and options exchanges, reporting 13.96 billion lots, which was up 99% on June 2023 and down 6% on May’s record of 14.857 billion contracts traded, FOW Data shows. Chart One: ASIAN FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING VOLUME The main drivers of growth in Asia are a handful of Indian equity index options contracts, listed on Mumbai’s National Stock Exchange of India and Bombay Stock Exchange, which currently host the six most-traded listed derivatives globally. The top contract in Asia and globally last month was the National Stock Exchange of India’s Nifty Bank index option which traded in June 4.208 billion contracts, which was up 65.6% on the same month in 2023, according to FOW Data. The NSE bank index option traded 12.071 billion lots in the second quarter, which represented an increase of two-thirds on the same quarter last year and a decline of 15.6% on the previous quarter, an all-time record for the Indian contract. The contract had open interest of 6.56 million lots at the end of June. The NSE Nifty Bank index option took in June top spot from NSE’s other main index option contract, the Nifty 50 index option. The Nifty 50 index option on the Indian blue-chip standard traded 4.112 billion lots last month, according to FOW Data, which was up 138.7% on June 2023, albeit down slightly from the trading record for the product in May. In the second quarter, the options contract was up 45.5% on the previous three months. This rapid increase was the main driver for the increase in overall Asia volumes in Q2. The open interest on the NSE Nifty 50 option was 10.35 million lots at the end of last month, according to FOW Data. Chart Two: NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA’S NIFTY BANK AND NIFTY 50 OPTIONS The two largest Indian index options contracts jointly contributed an extra 4 billion lots to the Asia June volumes compared to June 2023 and an additional 11.5 billion lots to the second quarter totals versus the same period last year. Another key factor in the Asian quarterly volume record has been the success of Bombay Stock Exchange’s S&P BSE Sensex equity index option, which references the oldest Indian index, made up of 30 of the largest and most liquid Indian blue-chips listed on the BSE. The S&P BSE Sensex equity option, which has emerged as the world’s third most popular listed derivative just over a year after launching in May 2023, reported 1.971 billion lots traded last month, which was more than 58 times the total in June last year but 14.2% below the previous month’s record of 2.297 billion lots. The BSE equity index option traded 5.853 billion lots last quarter, according to FOW Data, which was more than 175 times the volume in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the two larger NSE equity options contract, the BSE S&P Sensex equity options’ relatively low open interest of 42,650 lots suggests retail traders make up the vast majority of the activity in this market The fourth most-traded contact in Asia (and the world) is the National Stock Exchange of India’s Nifty Financial Services equity index option, which traded 1.264 billion lots in June, up 8.5% on the same month last year and 0.8% on the preceding month. The fifth most popular listed derivative is the S&P Bankex equity option on the BSE, which traded 617.4 million lots last month after launching in May last year, and sixth on the list is the NSE Nifty Midcap Select equity index option. The remainder of the global top ten list comprises three Brazilian futures traded on B3 and CME’s three month SOFR futures contract. Rutesh Durve, director of Business Development and Relationship Management at Nuvama Asset Services, told a FOW conference in April that, while India is perceived as complicated and difficult to access, there are different routes to market such as trading through an onshore broker or an international firm that has a presence in India. Durve said: “At some point, India becomes large enough that you need someone onshore.” FOW will host on September 19 2024 the fourth edition of its flagship Indian conference in Mumbai.

    "body": "July 19, 2024·15:39 IST July 19, 2024·15:54 IST Avdhut Bagkar Technical and Derivatives Analyst, StoxBox Indian shares traded lower on Friday due to weak global market cues and fears of new U.S.-China trade tensions. Despite opening at record highs, the Nifty 50 and Sensex quickly slipped into the red and fell sharply later in the session. India's benchmark stock indices ended their rally by hitting downward trends after a fresh record high for the fourth consecutive session on Friday. Sectors like Metal, Auto, Financial Services, and Energy saw significant declines. Brokerages' Stocks Fall As Microsoft Outage Impacts Operation. On the stock-specific front, Infosys shares rose after posting better-than-expected Q1 FY25 results and raising its FY25 revenue growth forecast to 3-4%. Other top gainers included Asian Paints, LTIMindtree, and Titan Company. In contrast, Persistent Systems fell nearly 7% after its Q1 profit missed estimates. The benchmark index initially opened 52 points higher but quickly faced selling pressure. After reaching a peak of 24854, it dropped over 100 points in the first few minutes of trading, accompanied by high volume, setting the tone for the day. The index continued to trend lower as selling pressure intensified, closing 269 points lower. Despite a significant correction and adverse market and momentum breadth, the index showed resilience by not dropping below the prior day’s low and closing above the psychological mark of 24500. Going forward, it will be crucial for the index to maintain support in the range of 24500-24200 to sustain bullish momentum. July 19, 2024·15:49 IST Riya Singh – Research Analyst, Commodities and Currency , Emkay Global Gold and silver prices experienced a sharp decline following the sentiment that the anticipated bullish phase might have occurred earlier than expected, leading to profit-taking. A recent slowdown in seasonal demand could exert downward pressure on prices if ETF flows do not persist or if tactical investors retreat due to high prices. U.S. data revealed the largest increase in initial jobless claims since early May, indicating a cooling labor market. This development supports a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Despite the recent dip, gold remains nearly 20% higher, and silver over 15% higher since the beginning of the year. Additionally, uncertainty in the U.S. political landscape is contributing to short-term volatility. This temporary decline is seen as a necessary adjustment, providing central bankers an opportunity to regain purchase traction. For Gold support is placed at $2385 - $2350 whereas for silver it is at $29. - $28.85 On the other hand, oil prices have continued to decline, influenced by weak demand from China and pressure from a stronger dollar. China's economy grew at a much slower pace than expected in the second quarter, countering the narrative of tight supply. However, the significant drawdown in U.S. stockpiles and improved compliance with production cuts by OPEC members are expected to keep the market undersupplied by more than a million barrels, thereby providing support for crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices are expected to find support around $78 to $80 per barrel. Meanwhile, the USD/INR is trading at an all-time low due to a stronger dollar and widespread weakness across Asian currencies. According to the latest bulletin released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank purchased $4.2 billion of forex. Additionally, the market is closely monitoring the Union budget for FY 2024-25, to be held on July 23rd, for a clearer picture of economic growth. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised India's growth projection from 6.8% to 7%. The rupee is expected to respect the resistance of 83.75 – 83.85 levels, with a potential retracement to the 83.50 level.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty 50 end lower— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Indian stock market ended slightly lower on Friday, May 30, tracking mixed global cues. The Sensex closed 182 points, or 0.22 per cent, lower at 81,451.01, while the Nifty 50 settled 24,750.70, 83 points, or 0.33 per cent, down on the first day of the June futures and options (F&O) series. Thus, the key indices extended losses to the second consecutive week. The mid and small-cap segments ended mixed. The BSE Midcap index fell 0.39 per cent, while theSmallcapindex rose 0.17 per cent. The Nifty extended the gains to the third consecutive month, rising nearly 2 per cent in May. However, the index has been consolidating in the recent past due to stretched valuations and the lack of fresh positive triggers. \"Participants are now awaiting a fresh trigger to break the consolidation and resume the broader trend. In the meantime, one should align their trades with sectoral trends and themes that are attracting noticeable interest,\" said Ajit Mishra, SVP of research at Religare Broking. \"We recommend maintaining a 'buy on dips' approach, unless the Nifty decisively breaks below its first line of defence—the 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), currently around the 24,600 level. A breach of this level could increase pressure and extend the current consolidation phase,\" said Mishra. Investors remain cautious amid a lack of fresh triggers and due to the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs. A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily allowed US President Donald Trump to proceed with his tariffs, a day after a US trade court had blocked them. Meanwhile, reports suggest India and the US are aiming to close a trade deal by the last week of June. However, the shape of the deal is still unclear. \"A rangebound movement continued in the market, with the temporary reinstatement of US tariffs by the appeal court influencing investors to stay sidelined,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. \"The global market may contend with macroeconomic concerns as the global trade landscape has yet to see stability, which may navigate a short-term consolidation,\" Nair said. India's Q4 GDP prints are due today, which could influence market sentiment. Next week, the RBI MPC will announce its policy decision. Moreover, the progress of monsoon will also be on the radar of the market. Only seven stocks managed to end higher in the Nifty 50 index. Shares of Eternal (up 4.98 per cent), SBI (up 2.09 per cent) andHDFC Bank(up 0.73 per cent) ended as the top gainers. Bajaj Auto (down 3.10 per cent),Hindalco Industries(down 2.51 per cent) and HCL Technologies (down 2 per cent) closed as the top losers in the index. Most sectoral indices ended with losses. However, the Nifty PSU Bank index soared 2.88 per cent, ending as the top gainer among them. Nifty Bank rose 0.37 per cent, while the Financial Services inched up 0.08 per cent. Nifty Metal dropped 1.69 per cent, while the IT index declined 1.15 per cent. Nifty Auto fell by a per cent. Vodafone Idea(70.12 crore shares), Suzlon (54.76 crore shares), andReliance Power(53.4 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Reliance Power, Rallis India,Lords Chloro Alkali,Manugraph IndiaandAro Granite Industries, were among the 17 stocks that jumped over 10 per cent on the NSE. Innovana Thinklabs,Kiri Industries, SKM Egg Products Export (India), Prakash Pipes, Signpost India and Welspun Living were the six stocks that plunged more than 10 per cent on the NSE. As many as 100 stocks, includingReliance Communications,Godfrey Phillips India, Senco Gold, International Gemmological Institute (India) and Wockhardt, hit their upper circuits in intraday trade on the NSE. On the other hand, 71 stocks, including Orchid Pharma, ITI,Indo Tech Transformers, Kitex Garments andCoffee Day Enterprises, hit lower circuits during the session.

    "body": "Indian stock market benchmarks- the Sensex and the Nifty 50- ended lower on Tuesday, June 17, on profit booking in select heavyweights, includingHDFC Bank, Reliance Industries andBajaj Financeamid weak global cues. The Sensex ended the day with a loss of 213 points, or 0.26 per cent, at 81,583.30, while the Nifty 50 closed at 24,853.40, down 93 points, or 0.37 per cent. Mid-caps and small-caps segments underperformed. The BSE Midcap index fell 0.56 per cent and theSmallcapindex declined 0.67 per cent. The overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to nearly₹448 lakh crore from nearly₹450.5 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors poorer by over₹2.5 lakh crore in a single session. The domestic market ended in negative territory amid heightened concerns over tensions between Israel and Iran. Investors also restricted their bets ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision on June 18. \"The benchmark equity index experienced moderate losses amid rising risk of an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East ahead of the FOMC meeting. This uncertainty pushed Brent crude prices higher—an unfavourable development for India, given its heavy reliance on oil imports, thereby dampening earnings growth,\" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, observed. Only 11 stocks managed to end in the green in the Nifty 50 index, among which Tech Mahindra (up 1.66 per cent), Infosys (up 0.87 per cent) and Asian Paints (up 0.86 per cent) ended as the top gainers. One stock- Wipro- ended flat. Shares ofAdani Enterprises(down 2.31 per cent), Eternal (down 2.06 per cent) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (down 2 per cent) ended as the top losers in the Nifty index. Barring Nifty IT (up 0.72 per cent), all sectoral indices ended lower. Nifty Pharma (down 1.89 per cent), Healthcare (down 1.79 per cent) and Metal (down 1.43 per cent) ended with significant losses. Nifty Bank (down 0.41 per cent) and Financial Services (down 0.39 per cent) also ended lower. Vishal Mega Mart (116.13 crore shares),Vodafone Idea(26.42 crore shares) andKBC Global(22.70 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Eight stocks, including Cinevista, KBC Global,Kshitij Polyline, Birla Cable andSterlite Technologies, jumped over 10 per cent on the NSE. As many as 91 stocks, including TechEra Engineering (India), Cinevista, MMTC, JNK India and KBC Global, hit their upper circuits in intraday trade on the NSE. On the other hand, 70 stocks, includingSuven Life Sciences, Sky Gold and Diamonds andReliance Power, hit their lower circuits in intraday trade on the NSE. The advance-decline ratio tilted towards the decliners. While 939 stocks advanced, as many as 1,946 declined, and 76 remained unchanged on the NSE. Some 79 stocks, including Bharat Electronics (BEL), Aditya Birla Capital, Max Healthcare Institute, Muthoot Finance and Solar Industries India, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. On the other hand, 48 stocks, including Aditya Vision, Ganesh Benzoplast, Navkar Urbanstructure and Protean eGov Technologies, hit their 52-week lows. According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, a reversal formation on intraday charts and a bearish candle on daily charts indicate temporary weakness. \"We believe that as long as the market is trading below 24,900, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. On the downside, 24,775 would be the immediate support zones for traders. Below this, the market could slip to 24,675-24,625. On the flip side, above 24,900, the sentiment could change. If it moves above this level, it could rally up to 25,000-25,100,\" said Chouhan.

    "title": "Indian stock market: 5 key triggers that could drive Nifty 50 to 26,000 in the short term",
    "body": "The Nifty 50, the benchmark of the Indian stock market, is hovering near 25,600, eyeing a reclaim of the 26,000 mark. The index is now about 3 per cent down from its all-time high of 26,277.35, which it scaled on September 27 last year. Amid global turmoil, tariff-related concerns and weak earnings, the domestic market has performed well in the first half of the calendar year 2025 (H1CY25). On a monthly scale, the Nifty 50 has been in the green since March this year. \"Nifty has managed to absorb most of the negative news in the last two months, from wars and geopolitics to the tariffs. While that was happening, global liquidity was rising. Whether you consider US M2 (measure of the money supply) going higher or the rate cuts in Europe and India. This has kept markets elevated and hopeful that the earnings slowdown will revive into the year-end,\" Rohit Srivastava, the founder and market strategist at Indiacharts.com, observed. The index is expected to scale fresh record highs in the second half of the year, as the medium-term outlook for the market remains positive, supported by the country’s healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and expectations that tariff-related uncertainties will recede. Let's take a look at five key factors that could drive the Nifty 50 to 26,000 or even to uncharted territories in the short term: Investors are focusing on the India-US trade negotiations as the 9 July deadline approaches. So far, only two countries—China and the UK—have signedtrade deals with the US. India and Japan are expected to be the next countries that could strike trade deals with the US. On Friday, Trump said that the White House was looking into anagreement with Indiathat would give it the “right to go in and trade” with the country. Meanwhile, a PTI report, quoting sources, suggested that India-US trade negotiations for an interim trade agreement are progressing well. A favourable trade deal could boost market sentiment, propelling the Nifty 50 to fresh highs. \"One big kicker for the market is the long-awaited US-India trade deal. A lot is expected, and more than anything else, expect the uncertainty to die. Business will be back to normal,\" said Arun Kejriwal, Founder of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. Q1FY26 earnings are expected to be better due to lower inflation, three successive rate cuts by the RBI and healthy macroeconomic growth. \"The larger section of companies is expected to benefit from three successive rate cuts by the RBI. The impact of the first two cuts will be felt on corporations' bottom lines, which should help in better earnings,\" said Kejriwal. Healthy earnings of Indian corporates will ease the concerns over elevated valuations and drive the market to the 26,000 mark or even beyond. The IMD has predicted an above-normal monsoon this year, which is expected to keep food inflation under control. Lower inflation would raise the prospects of further rate cuts by the RBI and reduce input costs for corporates, thereby augmenting their profitability. A healthy and evenly spread monsoon will also underpin market sentiment. G Chokkalingam, the founder and head of research of Equinomics Research Private Limited, pointed out that cumulative rainfall is also in surplus so far. \"As of this morning, cumulative rainfall as of yesterday in June is 8 per cent above the long-term average rainfall. This is a highly positive development for the markets. It can help the output of the agricultural sector to grow significantly and thereby help the overall GDP to grow faster,\" said Chokkalingam. \"A successful monsoon helps in moderating or keeping in check crop prices, and therefore inflation rates tend to remain modest. Already, bothretailand wholesale inflation rates are at record low levels. Therefore, a good monsoon would help in the continuation of the reversal of the interest rate cycle in the economy. The same would help both the economy and corporate world to gain from improvements in aggregate demand in the system,\" said Chokkalingam. The dollar index is hovering near its 52-week low. If it remains in this lower range for an extended period, it could potentially trigger healthy foreign capital inflows into the Indian market, driving it to new highs. \"We are looking at 28,000 by the year-end with the potential of upward revisions as markets price in a move to a dovish Fed in 2026. The falling dollar will drive better inflows into emerging markets, and India stands out as a winner there as well. A good monsoon and lower interest rates should create the growthmomentumfor this year,\" said Srivastava. Experts say if the index holds above 25,700 decisively, it may reclaim the 26,000 mark soon. According to Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research atAnand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, the 25,700–25,900 zone is likely to act as immediate resistance. \"A convincing breakout above this range could pave the way for a new leg higher. However, any close below 25,300 would signal a failed breakout,\" said Patel. Kejriwal said that the Nifty 50 index won't climb to the 26,000 mark quickly without supportive news flow. On the support side, Kejriwal said the 25,200 mark would act as strong support.

    "title": "Stock market crash: Sensex, Nifty 50 crack over 1.5% each; HMPV virus scare among 5 factors behind selloff",
    "body": "The Indian stock market crashed on Monday, January 6, with both benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, ending the session over 1.5% down amid heavy selling across the board, as reports of a new virus outbreak in China spooked investors. The Nifty 50 slipped below the crucial 24,000 mark and ended the session down 1.6% at 23,616 points, while the Sensex also tumbled 1.59% to 77,964 level. The broader market experienced even more pain, with the Nifty Smallcap 100 index and the Nifty Midcap 100 index plummeting by 3.2% and 2.7%, respectively. All major sectoral indices finished the session in negative territory withNifty PSU Bank, Nifty Metal, Nifty Energy, Nifty Realty, and Nifty Media falling the most, between 2.51% and 4%. In terms of individual stocks, 46 constituents of the Nifty 50 index closed in the red, with ITC emerging as the top laggard with a drop of 8.1%, followed by Tata Group stocks such as Tata Steel and Trent, which lost over 4% of their value. Other stocks, including BPCL, Coal India, NTPC, Adani Enterprises, Bharat Electronics, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid Corporation, Adani Ports & SEZ, and Asian Paints, all fell by between 3% and 4%. Here are the key reasons behind the fall in the Indian stock market today: Most Asian markets traded lower as sentiment remained cautious over the potential changes by the US President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially denting growth for a region heavily reliant on trade. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index lost 1.5%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 0.3%. The Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.2%. A case ofHuman Metapneumovirus(HMPV), said to be responsible for a spike in respiratory illnesses in China, has reportedly been detected in Bengaluru on Monday. According to news reports, an eight-month-old child in Bengaluru tested positive for HMPV, a similar virus to COVID-19, that can cause respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. A sharp fall in index heavyweights such as Tata Steel,Reliance Industries,HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank,ITC,Tata Motors, among others dragged the markets lower. A gauge of Asian currencies hit its lowest in almost two decades against the dollar and equities fluctuated, with gains from a buoyant chip sector countered by declines in Japanese stocks. The dollar traded near a two-year peak on Monday. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading around 108.74. The US dollar rose to 157.77 Japanese yen from 157.22 yen. The euro cost $1.0316, up from $1.0306. Nifty 50 has broken its key support levels, which has intensified selling pressure. “Nifty 50holds a good view until it stays above its 200 DMA which is placed at 23,900. While with inter month perspective Nifty direction will depend on what Donald Trump will do after he takes office as US President on January 20th 2025. Considering both the events upside on Nifty is likely to be capped. Technically, the landscape suggests Nifty’s major support at 23,905 / 23,727 mark. Intermonth support seen at 23,000 mark.

    "title": "Why did Sensex, Nifty crash today? 5 reasons why stock market is down",
    "body": "Domestic stock markets nosedived on Monday, with benchmark indices witnessing sharp losses. The S&P BSE Sensex plummeted as much as 1,200 points, while the NSE Nifty50 fell well over 2% to hit an intraday low of 23,601.50. At around 2:49 pm, the Sensex was down 1373.20 points to 77,871.20 and the Nifty50 tumbled 420.10 points to trade at 23,551.90. Thedownturn was driven by a combination of domestic and global factors, triggering a broad sell-off across sectors. Volatility spiked as the Nifty50’s volatility index rose to 14.5, indicating heightened nervousness among investors. Broader market indices, including Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100, faced steep declines of 2.60% and 2.40%, respectively. The sell-off was particularly severe in PSU banking, metals, and realty sectors, with no sector managing to stay in the green. Experts have identified multiple reasons behind the market crash, ranging from the detection of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases in India to weak global cues and ongoing FPI outflows. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted, “The market is likely to be influenced by the negative factors impacting FII flows and some positive domestic factors which can support the market.” Global economic conditions remain unfavourable, with a high dollar index at 109 and the 10-year US bond yield at 4.62%. Dr. Vijayakumar explained, “The FIIs are likely to continue selling till the yields decline and the dollar stabilises.” These global challenges are weighing heavily on Indian markets. Concerns over weak business updates from key sectors, particularly banking and FMCG, have further dampened sentiment. Chowdhury noted, “Markets have been under pressure primarily due to weak business updates by companies, especially banks and some FMCG stocks.” Last but not least, the discovery of two HMPV cases in Bengaluru sparked panic among investors. Although the virus is not expected to have the same impact as Covid-19, it led to a knee-jerk reaction in the markets. Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox, remarked, “Market sentiment may have turned a little sour due to initial HMPV cases found in India, but its impact may be limited as the fatality seems to be lower compared to the Covid virus.” With corporate earnings, the upcoming budget, and global trade policies on the horizon, market volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term.

    "title": "Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on January 7 as HMPV virus cases rise",
    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Tuesday following gains in global markets. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a positive start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,780 level, a premium of nearly 60 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Monday, the domestic equity market crashed, with the benchmark Nifty 50 slipping below 23,700 level. TheSensexslumped 1,258.12 points, or 1.59%, to close at 77,964.99, while the Nifty 50 settled 388.70 points, or 1.62%, lower at 23,616.05. Nifty 50 formed a long bear candle that has negated the bullish sentiment created in the last week. “The candle pattern of Monday is indicating a bull trap of recent upside breakout and this signals more weakness in the short term. The recent upside breakout of range has been negated and the Nifty 50 slipped below the crucial 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) again at 23,700 levels for the third time. Hence, the next support of 23,500 - 23,400 levels could be in danger of violation,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the short-term trend ofNifty 50is weak and one may expect some more weakness in the coming sessions. The next lower supports are seen in the vicinity of 23,460 and 23,260 levels. Any upside bounce could find hurdle around 23,800, he added. Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty 50 witnessed a steep decline on January 6 and closed the day lower by 388 points. “Technical indicators presented a mixed outlook for the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 40.7, trending downward, indicating bearish momentum. In contrast, the Stochastic RSI showed a bullish crossover, hinting at a potential short-term recovery. This divergence in indicators suggests caution, as the market lacks a clear directional bias,” said Mandar Bhojane, Research Analyst at Choice Broking. He advises investors to monitor price action closely near critical support and resistance levels. The interplay between these technical indicators and market trends will determine whether the Nifty 50 stabilizes or faces further downside pressure in the coming sessions, he added. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, expects Nifty 50 to hover for support near 23,470 and 23,200 and notice resistance near 23,650 and 23,720 and the broader sentiment is likely to remain bearish. Bank Nifty index slumped 1,066.80 points, or 2.09%, to close at 49,922.00 on Monday. “Bank Niftywitnessed heavy profit booking as the day progressed and has breached below the significant support zone of the 200 period MA at 50,700 levels after a very long time, weakening the overall bias and has arrived near the critical support zone of 49,700 levels where previously, on thrice occasion it had indicated a positive reversal from this zone,” said Vaishali Parekh, Vice President — Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher. According to her, a decisive breach below the 50,700 zone shall invite intensified selling pressure, with the overall trend turning bearish with the 48,500 level as the next necessary support.

    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open lower on Wednesday tracking weak global cues. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a negative start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,734 level, a discount of nearly 70 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Tuesday, the Indian stock market indices ended the last session of the year 2024 with minor losses amid a lackluster trade. TheSensexfell 109.12 points, or 0.14%, to close at 78,139.01, while the Nifty 50 settled flat at 23,644.80. Nifty 50 formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with minor upper and lower range. “Technically, this market action is indicating counter attack by bulls after an attempt of false downside breakout of the range movement. The crucial 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is in the limelight again. After moving below this moving average on Monday, Nifty has failed to show any decisive follow -through weakness in the subsequent session and showed upside bounce from the lows,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. Nifty 50 formed a small red candle on the weekly chart, placed beside the similar green candle of last week, which signals a broader range movement in the market. “The upside bounce of Tuesday could be an early indication of another round of upside bounce in the market.Nifty 50is broadly in a range of 23,500 - 24,000 levels for the near term. Having bounced back from the lower range of 23,500 levels, one may expect further upside bounce towards 24,000 levels in the coming week,” Shetti said. Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty Open Interest (OI) data indicates the highest OI on the call side at the 23,800 and 24,000 strike prices, highlighting strong resistance levels. On the put side, OI is concentrated at the 23,500 and 23,200 strike prices, marking these as key support levels, said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking. Nifty 50 showed upside recovery from the lows on December 31 and closed the day flat. “Following a weak start, the Nifty 50 recovered smartly during the day. However, the technical setup remains unchanged as the index failed to break above any significant moving averages. Despite this, sentiment appeared to improve throughout the session. On the higher end, if Nifty 50 moves above 23,700, it could advance towards 23,900-24,000. On the lower end, support is placed at 23,550,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities. According to VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, the market is expected to remain weak in the coming weeks, turning 2025 into a more challenging year for investors compared to the uptrend in 2023 and 2024. “Amid these developments, Nifty could expect support levels at 23,210 and 22,970 and resistance at 23,610 and 23,750. Similarly, Bank Nifty could find support at 50,350 and 49,800 and face resistance near 51,170 and 51,350,” said Ambala. Bank Nifty index recovered from day's low and ended 92.55 points, or 0.18%, lower at 50,860.20 on Tuesday, forming a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily chart. “Technically, theBank Niftyindex reversed from trendline support and defended its 200-Days simple moving average (200-DSMA), which is near 50,600. Furthermore, the index has formed a green candle on the daily chart, indicating strength. On the upside, 50-Days Exponential Moving Average (50-DEMA) is placed near 51,915 which will act as resistance,” said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. (A Pantomath Group Company). In the short term, he expects Bank Nifty to trade within the 50,500 – 52,000 range, with a breakout in either direction determining its future direction.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty 50 fall for third consecutive session. What is driving Indian stock market down? Explained with 5 factors",
    "body": "Stock market today:Falling for the third consecutive session, Indian stock market benchmarks - the Sensex and the Nifty 50- declined over half a per cent each in intraday trade on Friday, January 10, amid weak global cues, rising US dollar and bond yields. Sensex opened at 77,682.59 against its previous close of 77,620.21 and dropped over 500 points, or 0.70 per cent, to the intraday low of 77,099.55. The index finally closed 241 points, or 0.31 per cent, lower at 77,378.91. The Nifty 50 opened at 23,551.90 against its previous close of 23,526.50 and declined over 180 points, or 0.80 per cent, to 23,344.35. The index ended with a loss of 95 points, or 0.40 per cent, at 23,431.50. The selloff was more intense in the mid and small-cap segments. The BSE Midcap and Smalllcap indices plunged 2.13 per cent and 2.40 per cent, respectively. The Sensex has dropped 1 per cent, while the Nifty 50 has fallen 1.2 per cent in the last three sessions. The BSE Midcap index has fallen 4.13 per cent, while the BSE Smallcap index has lost 4.6 per cent. Investors have lost nearly₹12 lakh crore in these three days as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms has dropped to below₹430 lakh crore from nearly₹442 lakh crore on January 7. \"The recent fall in the Indian stock market can be attributed to several interconnected factors. Some of them include the significant outflow of foreign capital from Indian markets, the emergence of the HMPV virus and the Indian rupee's fall against the US dollar. Additionally, weakness in Asian markets has compounded the negative outlook for Indian equities overall,\" said Atul Parakh, CEO of Bigul. Most sectoral indices suffered significant losses, except for the Nifty IT index which jumped 3.44 per cent due to a healthy Q3 result of heavyweight TCS. Among the losers, Nifty Media (down 3.59 per cent), Realty (down 2.77 per cent), PSU Bank (down 2.72 per cent), Healthcare (down 2.21 per cent), Pharma (down 2.13 per cent), Consumer Durables (down 1.80 per cent), Private Bank (down 1.74 per cent) and Metal (down 1.62 per cent) lost 2-4 per cent. Here are the five crucial factors, according to experts, that are driving the Indian stock market down. Let's take a look: Traders and investors are cautious ahead of the December quarter earnings. India's IT bellwetherTata Consultancy Services(TCS) reported its December quarter (Q3) numbers on Thursday, January 9, which were largely in line with market expectations. “Since the results season has started, the market will witness lots of stock-specific action in response to the results. Results of TCS indicate that the IT sector will continue to remain resilient. Results of banking majors will be good, but in the context of FII selling, the sector may not perform in response to the results,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. US benchmark 10-year bond yields and the dollar have been rising in light of strong US macro data and waning prospects of a significant rate cut by the US Fed this year. US treasury yields were near eight-month highs on Friday. This has been a major negative for emerging markets like India as elevated bond yields and a strong dollar trigger foreign capital outflow. Till January 9, FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) have sold off Indian equities worth over₹19,000 crore. This trend may continue due to uncertainty surrounding President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies and the US Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Concerns over Indian economic growth losing steam appear to weigh investors' risk appetite. As Mintreported,India's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 6.4 per cent in the financial year 2024-25, according to the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation's (MoSPI) official release on Tuesday, January 7. This marks a four-year low and a fall from its 8.2 per cent growth in the financial year 2024-25. Slowing growth has raised concerns about downgrades, further accelerating the fall in the Indian currency and the outflow of foreign capital. Meanwhile, media reports suggested that the global financial services firm HSBC has downgraded Indian equities from 'neutral' to 'overweight' amid concerns over high valuations and slowing growth momentum. The recent strong US macro data and expectations of a rise in inflation have raised concerns that theUS Fedmay not go for even two rate cuts this year. According to Reuters, the minutes from the US Federal Reserve's last meeting revealed that policymakers expect inflation to keep slowing down this year. However, they also noted a growing risk that inflation could remain stubborn, partly due to concerns aboutDonald Trump'spolicies. Trump will take office on January 20. There is much speculation about his plans for tariffs and protectionist measures. Experts believe his policies may drive up inflation, which would be a severe blow to the central bank's efforts to keep price rises under control. Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, observed the index formed a bearish candle on the daily charts and a lower top formation on the intraday charts, indicating further weakness from the current levels. \"For traders now, 23,650/78,000 will be the key level to watch; below this level, the market could continue its weak formation till 23,400-23,375/77,300-77,200. If the indices rise above 23,650/78,000, they could bounce back to 23,750-23,800/78,300-78,500. Short-term traders should remain cautious and be very selective, as there is a risk of getting trapped at lower levels,\" said Chouhan. According to Reliance Securities, Nifty 50 has failed to break 24,800 levels on multiple counts andclosed near the lower range of the support levels in the previous session. The next band is at 23,250 levels. \"On the higher side, the crossover of the resistance band of 24,000-24,150 levels will witness a broader up-move across sectors and stocks. RSI has failed to sustain an above-the-average line and is trending lower, while other key technical indicators are in neutral mode from current levels. The highest call OI has moved lower to 24,000 strikes, while the downside, the highest put is at 23,000 for the weekly expiry,\" said Reliance Securities.

Fears of lofty valuation multiples alongside trimmed earnings expectations have led to a steady decline for theNifty 50. The index has now re-entered correction territory – a 10% fall – since its most recent high in late September. In fact, year to date, the benchmark is now in the red. That’s hardly out of the ordinary for investors, however. By my count, the Nifty 50 turned negative by the fifth trading day of the year in seven of the past 10 years. However, this time it’s different. Many analysts arrived into the new year raising concerns about elevated valuations and slowing earnings growth at companies. It’s a far cry from the bullish sentiment of yesteryear that the Indian stock market would race ahead of theS&P 500, which rose by more than 20% for the second year in a row. Equity strategists at HSBC believe the glum mood gripping markets is likely to continue. “As earnings disappoint – consensus has cut [financial year 2025] growth estimates for the NIFTY 50 from 15% to 5% – investors will likely re-evaluate their positions, limiting market returns,” said the bank’s Asia Pacific strategists led by Herald van der Linde in a note to clients Thursday. The investment bank downgraded Indian equities to neutral. Morgan Stanley pointed out that stocks last year, for the first time in eight years, performed worse than bonds and gold (which, to be fair, outperformed most global markets). ″Over the long run, we think equities will lead in financial assets and gold will shine among physical assets,” said the investment bank’s Ridham Desai. Many also believe that Indian equities, after their long slide, are now ripe for picking. “India has bottomed out,” wrote Venugopal Garre, strategist at Bernstein, in a note to clients last week. Garre is expecting economic growth to pick up over the next three to six months and is urging investors to get ahead of the turnaround. “Investing ahead of the recovery is suggested,” he added. Bernstein expects the Nifty 50 to end the year at 26,500, up 13% from current levels. Morgan Stanley says the central government is likely to reduce the fiscal deficit in February when it unveils its budget, which could lower bond yields and reduce borrowing costs for companies. This view is echoed by equity strategists at Citi. They expect the Indian economy to expand by 6.5% this year, driven by a boost from the government’s infrastructure spending, which was in the doldrums last year. “We have a constructive outlook on equity returns given the market’s more reasonable valuations post recent corrections,” said Citi’s Surendra Goyal in a note to clients. The investment bank also expects Nifty to end the year at 26,000 – up 10.5%. India’s authorities expect its economy to grow 6.4% in fiscal year 2024-2025.The Indian National Statistical Office provided its first advance forecast on Tuesday, thelowest since 2020when India’s gross domestic product shrank 5.8% because of the pandemic. The estimate is lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s projection of 6.6% for the current fiscal year. Here’s what economists at HSBC and HDFC Bankthink of the estimate. India wants the country’s overseas missions to help boost exports.The Indian Commerce Ministry has asked Indian missions toincrease market intelligence effortsand identify export opportunities, government sources told CNBC-TV18. Commercial heads from Indian missions in 20 key countries will gather for a three-day meeting, organized by the ministry, that will focus on growing exports. Trump’s second term will benefit Indian stocks, portfolio manager says. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose heavy tariffs on China makeIndia’s geopolitical positioning“favorable in this Trump 2.0 era,” according to GIB Asset Management’s portfolio manager Kunal Desai. “A number of Indian companies are taking advantage as customers look to take a dual source approach to their supply chain,” Desai said. India is a “compounding machine.”Investor interest in India waned at the end of 2024 because of a pullback in Indian equities during that period. One portfolio manager, however, remains bullish on the country. The dip in the market is a buying opportunity, he says, andnames three Indian stocks to buyfor 2025. [For subscribers only] Indian stocks started the year sliding. TheNifty 50index closed around 23,500 points, a decline of 1.8% since last week. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield has been flat so far this year and has traded around 6.76%. On CNBC TV this week, BNP Paribas’ head of Indian equities, Abhiram Eleswarapu, thinks Indian markets are going through “a soft phase” at the moment because valuations are at an elevated level. However, this “shallow correction” might be ending, and marketscouldreturn high single digitsfrom March until the end of the year, Eleswarapu said. Meanwhile, Pulkit Patn, India industrials analyst at Goldman Sachs, noted that the bankexpectsIndia’s cement industry to expand in the second half of the year, which suggests that “infrastructure spending is coming back.” Government expenditure, residential real estate and rural spending will form the bulk of such investment, resulting inrelatively strong demand for infrastructureand related materials.

    "title": "SENSEX, NIFTY50 continue to bleed, down 12% from record highs; top factors behind the market's free fall",
    "body": "4 min read | Updated on January 13, 2025, 12:17 IST The NIFTY50 and SENSEX fell over 2% last week as Indian markets continued to face an exodus of foreign capital, largely influenced by rising US treasury yields. In addition, slower GDP growth and no fireworks expected in the earnings season have dampened investor sentiments NIFTY50 has fallen nearly 12% from the record high levels touched in September 2024. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who once had a substantial stake in Indian equities reduced their holdings to multi-decade lows in 2024. The overly pessimistic stance continued in 2025 as global market dynamics changed dramatically. FIIs’ net buying in the Indian markets reduced by 99% to ₹427 crore in 2024 as against ₹1,20,000 crore in 2023. The provisional figures for the first 10 days of 2025 suggest that they sold equities worth more than ₹18,000 crore in the secondary markets. Rising treasury yields in the US have added more worries as FIIs move away from risky emerging markets like India to treasury investments in the US. The US 10-year yields traded at 4.7%, up from 3.6% in September 2024, a 32% jump in four months. The rise in treasury yields is significant as interest rates dropped 50 bps during the same period. Rising treasury yields highlight two things. First, inflation is expected to increase in the days ahead, indicating a slower rate-cut cycle or a potential tightening of monetary policy. Second, rising treasury yields drive the money flow back to the US markets as investors get higher returns on safe-haven assets like government bonds. Consequently, we see more and more FII outflow from Indian markets. When money flows out of emerging markets like India, it puts high pressure on the domestic currency and causes it to depreciate further. The rising dollar index severely impacted the Indian currency in 2024, when it depreciated nearly 4% from its peak in September 2024. The sharp devaluation of the rupee poses challenges, from rising import bills to higher oil prices, adding inflation worry to the domestic economy. Moreover, it also reduces rupee-denominated returns for foreign investors, making the Indian markets unattractive. As a result, we may see more FII outflow from the Indian markets. India’s GDP growth for FY25 was revised lower to 6.6% as the economy struggles from slower credit growth and a drop in consumer spending and demand. The revised estimates for the GDP growth are the lowest in four years and much lower than previous estimates of RBI (Reserve Bank of India) at 7.2%. This can be attributed mainly to slower public and private investment, weakened manufacturing, and lower consumer spending. Further, interest rates have stayed higher for longer than estimated, impacting credit growth in the economy, which has come down to 11% in 2024 from the peak of 16% in 2023. Domestic indices, especially the NIFTY midcap and small-cap indices, traded at higher valuations when the underlying earnings growth of the companies remained muted. This reduces investor appetite for paying premium valuations for Indian companies in the absence of strong growth. The ongoing Q3FY25 result season is also expected to be a weakshow regarding earnings growth, as advanced business updates suggest pain in the underlying economy. Despite being the fastest-growing economy in the world with 5.4% GDP growth for Q2FY25, Indian markets continue to face a mass exodus of foreign capital from secondary markets. However, FIIs have bought into the primary market opportunities through QIB and QIPs in secondary issues. The global market cues remain weak, with the top two economies (US and China) struggling on multiple fronts. The impending trade war scenario makes the outlook bleak in the near term. However, investors remain optimistic about the upcoming budget for some economic stimulus, which could end the dry run in the Indian markets.

The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,721 level, a discount of nearly 60 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Wednesday, the domestic equity market recovered from day’s low to end flat with negative bias. TheSensexeased 50.62 points, or 0.06%, to close at 78,148.49, while the Nifty 50 settled 18.95 points, or 0.08%, lower at 23,688.95. Nifty 50 formed a small red candle on the daily chart with a long lower shadow. “Technically, this market action indicates a formation of ‘hammer’ type candle pattern. Normally, such hammer formation after a reasonable decline calls for an impending trend reversal on the upside post confirmation. Though, Nifty 50 placed below the crucial 200-day EMA (Exponental Moving Average) at 23,700 levels, there is an absence of sharp break down below this key support. This 200 DEMA has offered significant trend reversal on upside in the past,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the short term trend ofNifty 50remains weak, but the smart upside recovery from near 23,500 levels is indicating chances of an upside bounce in the coming sessions. “A sustainable move above the hurdle of 23,800 levels could confirm an upside bounce in the market. Immediate support is placed at 23,496 levels,” Shetti said. Here’s what to expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty Open Interest (OI) data indicates the highest OI on the call side at the 23,800 and 24,000 strike prices, highlighting strong resistance levels. On the put side, OI is concentrated at the 23,600 and 23,500 strike prices, marking these as key support levels, said Hardik Matalia, Derivative analyst at Choice Broking. Nifty 50 witnessed a smart upside recovery from the lows on January 8 after showing a deep cut in the early-mid part of the session and settled the day lower by 18 points. “Nifty 50 index is trading within a range of 23,500 to 24,200. In Wednesday’s session, it formed a hammer candlestick on the daily chart, closing near its 200-day EMA, thereby strengthening the 23,500 support level. A decisive move will require the index to close below 23,500, which could lead to heightened selling pressure, or sustain above 24,000 to pave the way for a potential rally toward 24,500. Monitoring these crucial levels is essential to identify the next trend in the index,” said Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. Dr. Praveen Dwarakanath, Vice President of Hedged.in highlighted that the Nifty 50 tested its critical support at the 23,500 level again, however, it bounced from the same level, indicating a mild bullishness in the index. “The ADX average line is nearing the 40 level, suggesting that the weakness in the daily timeframe is decreasing. It also indicates a small bounce from present levels, which can be used to sell the index on the rise. The momentum indicators on the daily chart are rising from the oversold region, also indicating a possible bounce from the current levels,” said Dwarakanath. According to him, the options writer’s data for the January monthly expiry showed increased writing of the calls at the 23,400 and above levels with a short covering of 24,000 puts, suggesting a weakness to continue in January month for the index. Bank Nifty index declined 367.10 points, or 0.73%, to close at 49,835.05 on Wednesday, forming a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe. “Bank Niftybroke its critical support at 49,500 levels, however it bounced during the day. The index has closed below the 50,000 level, indicating a possible weakness in the index. Any bounce in the index can be used to sell on every rise until the index breaks the 51,600 level. The ADX average line is rising with the ADX DI- line also rising, indicating a possible weakness in the index,” said Dwarakanath. Options writer’s data for the monthly expiry showed increased writing of the calls at the 50,000 level, suggesting a weakness in the index, he added. Om Mehra, Technical Analyst, SAMCO Securities said that the Bank Nifty index breaking below the 49,964 level, a key support that had remained unbroken since August 14, 2024, further weakened the overall trend. “The daily RSI hovers near the oversold zone, reflecting the ongoing bearish pressure. However, the Bollinger Bands on the daily chart indicate that the index remains in the lower band. If 50,200 is sustained, a relief rally may emerge in the coming session. The support level is positioned at 49,450, which could act as a cushion in case of further declines. Premature attempts to capture bottoms should be avoided until a strong base is firmly established,” Mehra added.

    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Tuesday, amid mixed cues from global peers. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a gap-up start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,280 level, a premium of nearly 118 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Monday, the domestic equity market crashed and the benchmark Nifty 50 slipped below 23,100 level. TheSensexcracked 1,048.90 points, or 1.36%, to close at 76,330.01, while the Nifty 50 settled 345.55 points, or 1.47%, lower at 23,085.95. Nifty 50 formed a reasonable negative candle on the daily chart with gap down opening and with a long upper shadow. “Technically, this pattern indicates a decisive downside breakout of a symmetrical triangle pattern with lack of strength to bounce back. The immediate support of 23,260 has been violated on the downside and the market is now placed to slide further lows. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him,Nifty 50is on the way down to the next lower support of around 22,800 - 22,700 levels, and any pullback up to 23,350 could be a sell-on-rise opportunity. Here’s what top expect from Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty 50 witnessed sharp weakness on January 13 and closed the day lower by 345 points. “Bears remained at the helm as the Nifty 50 continued to breach crucial levels. The index slipped below its previous swing low on the daily chart, indicating increasing bearishness. However, it held the 23,000 mark, which remains a key level to watch. If the Nifty sustains above 23,000 over the next few days, it could signal a potential recovery. Conversely, a decisive fall below this level might trigger a deeper correction,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, noted that both Nifty 50 and Sensex closed below their 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a key technical level, signaling further selling pressure. “The Nifty is now only 3% away from its 20-month EMA, which had been identified earlier as a critical support zone. Meanwhile, mid-cap stocks also witnessed heavy selling due to profit bookings. However, this pullback could offer long-term investors opportunities to accumulate quality stocks at attractive valuations. On technical charts, Nifty formed an Inverted Hammer candlestick pattern during the day, indicating a strong upper price rejection,” Ambala said. Considering these developments, Ambala expects Nifty 50 to gain support between 22,950 and 22,800 and face resistance between 23,050 and 23,100 in today’s trading session. Bank Nifty plunged 692.90 points, or 1.42%, to close at 48,041.25 on Monday, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe. “Bank Niftymaintained below its 250-Days Simple Moving Average (250-DSMA) support which is placed near 49,900 levels and formed a red candle on daily scale, indicating weakness. On the downside, 100-WEMA support is placed near 47,300 levels, which will act as key support,” said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd. (A Pantomath Group Company). According to him, as long as Bank Nifty maintains below 49,900 levels, traders are advised to follow a sell-on-rise strategy.

    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Friday tracking positive global market cues. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a positive start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,303 level, a premium of nearly 40 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Thursday, the domestic equity market ended higher, with the benchmark Nifty 50 closing above 23,200 level. TheSensexrose 115.39 points, or 0.15%, to close at 76,520.38, while the Nifty 50 settled 50.00 points, or 0.22%, higher at 23,205.35. Nifty 50 formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with minor upper shadow. “Technically, this market action signals a gradual follow-through upmove in the market amidst range movement. The bearish lower tops and bottoms is intact and the current pullback rally could possibly open another lower top formation in the short term. The broader high low range remains intact around 23,400 - 23,000 levels. Having bounced back from the lower range, the Nifty could move up gradually towards the upper range of 23,400 levels in the near term,’ said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, a decisive move above 23,400 levels could open renewed buying enthusiasm in the market and immediate support is placed at 23,000 levels. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty Open Interest (OI) data indicates the highest OI on the call side at the 23,300 and 23,500 strike prices, highlighting strong resistance levels. On the put side, OI is concentrated at the 23,000 and 22,800 strike prices, marking these as key support levels, said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking. Sensex continued its positive momentum on Thursday and ended up by 115 points above the 76,500 level. “Technically, after a muted open, the market held positive momentum throughout the day. It also formed a reversal formation on the daily charts, which supports a further uptrend from the current levels. We are of the view that as long asSensexis trading above 76,200, the pullback formation is likely to continue,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. On the higher side, the Sensex could bounce back to the 77,000 - 77,100 range. On the other hand, if it falls below 76,200, the sentiment could change, and the Sensex may retest levels of 76,000 - 75,700. Nifty 50 continued with minor upmove with range bound action on January 23 and closed the day higher by 50 points. “Nifty 50 failed to break above the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the hourly chart, indicating selling pressure at higher levels. The bearish trend is likely to persist as long as the index stays below 23,400. On the downside, support levels are observed at 23,150 and 23,000,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. According to Om Mehra, Technical analyst, SAMCO Securities, Nifty’s recovery follows the Hammer candlestick formation at the critical support zone near 23,000, reflecting a potential reversal signal. “This recovery inNifty 50was further supported by a double-bottom formation on the hourly chart, highlighting an emerging bullish setup. However, a decisive breakout and sustained move above 23,400 would be pivotal to confirm a shift in trend from bearish to bullish. The index is currently hovering near its 9 EMA. The daily RSI is recovering from lower levels, though it remains tilted to the downside,” Mehra said. The advance-decline ratio is gradually improving, indicating an emerging balance. The support remains at the 23,000 level. The India VIX, the fear gauge, settled at 16.69, and a dip below the 16 mark could provide the much-needed tailwind for bullish momentum to strengthen, he added. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, expects the market to remain sideways to bearish in the short term, with heightened volatility anticipated ahead of the budget, as indicated by a potential surge in the India VIX. “In this situation, I suggest investors hedge their portfolios and set a long-term view of 2 to 3 years. The Nifty 50 could expect a support level between 23,200 and 23,120 and resistance near 23,405 and 23,520,” Ambala said. Bank Nifty index closed Thursday’s session at 48,589, slipping 135.40 points, or 0.28%, as the index failed to capitalize on the previous session’s Dragonfly Doji formation. “Bank Niftyis hovering near its 9 EMA, with the daily RSI showing some recovery from lower levels but still leaning toward the downside. On the hourly chart, Nifty Bank is positioned near the middle Bollinger Band, reflecting its non-directional stance. A breakout above 48,750 could open the door for further upside, while a fall below 48,250 may indicate a bearish shift,” said Om Mehra. The index appears poised for range-bound movement in the near term, with the potential for volatility on both sides as it awaits clear directional cues, he added.

    "title": "Stock market slide: 12% crash in 4 months leaves investors shaken",
    "body": "The Indian stock market has witnessed a drastic fall since the Sensex touched an all-time high of Rs 85,978.84 on September 27 last year with large-cap stocks leading the downslide. The benchmark index has plummeted by a whopping 10,000 points, or 11.79 per cent, over the past four months, marking a stark reversal of fortunes and leaving investors shaken and grappling with substantial losses. The NSE Nifty Index has also taken a hit, falling by 12.38 per cent during the same period. Large cap stocks took the maximum hit as foreign investors sold heavily, leading to a 13.27 per cent fall in NSE large-cap index in four months. The sell-off has been widespread, affecting large, medium, and small capital companies across the board — the NSE Mid-cap index has dropped by 12.85 per cent, while the small-cap index has tanked by 9.87 per cent. While IT shares remained largely unaffected, capital intensive sectors like automobile and oil & gas suffered badly. The reasons for thisbloodbathare not far to seek. The economic landscape has undergone significant changes, with India’s GDP growth slowing down and high-frequency indicators moderating throughout 2024. Although these indicators show signs of bottoming out, the market faces additional headwinds. Foodinflationremains high and sticky, while high US bond yields have strengthened the dollar against most currencies, including the rupee. Commodity prices have also started to rise, diminishing the prospects of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India. The aftermath of the US presidential election has further exacerbated the situation, with investors increasingly favouring dollar assets. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have sold off most emerging market equities, including those in India. Mutual fund holdings of investors have suffered badly with net asset values of schemes plunging across the board. “XIRR (extended internal rate of return) of my investments in a mid- and small-cap scheme has fallen by 21 per cent in the last couple of months. Still experts advise me to keep on investing through SIPs (systematic investment plan) despite the sell-off in the market. I’m a little worried but hopeful of a recovery as the past track record of recoveries in the market,” said Jacob Cyriac, a software engineer now based in the US. XIRR is a parameter used to calculate the returns on a mutual fund investment. It’s useful for investments with irregular cash flows, such as those made through an SIP. Despite the sell-off, equity funds saw a 14.5 per cent rise in inflows to Rs 41,156 crore in December. When valuations are very high, some unexpected negative triggers can cause sharp corrections. In September, valuations were very high and the economy was in a sweet spot because the GDP growth was high and corporate earnings were robust. “Suddenly the situation changed with the Q2 GDP numbers, which came worse-than-expected. It was the beginning. The decline in the GDP growth was reinforced by the Q2 corporate results which were also lower-than-expected,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The country’s GDP growth slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in the second quarter of FY2025. Key high-frequency indicators such as banking credit growth, personal loans growth, GST collections and rail and port traffic have slowed over the last one year, which is reflecting in the slowing GDP growth, global investment bank BNP Paribas said. TheTrump factorthen contributed to the havoc. “We sawDonald Trump’s victory which led to a rise in the US dollar. The 10-year US bond yield also rose by 100 basis points (bps) even after Trump’s victory. When the 10-year US bond is yielding 4.7 percent, there is no logic for foreign investors to invest in emerging markets, particularly when the valuations are high. This led to a relentless selling by FPIs,” Vijaykumar said. FPIs sold Rs 94,017 crore of equities in October and Rs 21,612 crore in November. After buying Rs 15,446 crore worth of equities in December, they resumed selling in the first month of 2025, offloading Rs 51,748 crore till January 21, according to the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) data. Mid and small-cap correction may not be over In the large cap, corrections are almost done but that may not be the case for mid- and small-cap stocks. “However, we can see another 3-4 per cent correction in adverse circumstances. In mid and small caps, there is more room for correction,” Vijaykumar said. “The market has corrected from high. It is down 13-14 per cent from the peak. Nifty was around 26,000 and now it is at 23,000. If it (the fall) is more than 20 per cent, we can say that we are crashing. In the past also whenever we have seen corrections it was to the tune of around 15 per cent,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. Over the last four years, the rally in Indian equities has been supported by strong earnings growth besides domestic flows. However, the situation has changed now in the industrial sector. “TheNifty 50EPS more than doubled over FY20-24, recovering from a low base. However, in the last six months, we have seen broad-based earnings estimate cuts. Initial trends for the December 2024 quarter, as highlighted in business updates by the companies, do not seem very encouraging,” said Kunal Vora, Head of India Equity Research, BNP Paribas. Market capitalisation, or the total value of all listed shares, of the BSE-listed firms declined by Rs 53.86 lakh crore since September 27, 2024 to Rs 438.79 lakh crore on January 21, 2025. The loss is across the board with mutual funds and retail investors taking the hit. The unique registered investor base on the NSE crossed the 11-crore mark this week, NSE said on Wednesday. Many high performing sectors fared badly in the last four months. Automobile shares were hit hard with the NSE Auto Index plunging 19.22 per cent and oil & gas plunging 17.47 per cent. Metal shares also lost ground with sector index falling 15.23 per cent. However, IT shares managed to stay afloat despite the immense selling pressure but lost only 1.45 per cent. What’s the way ahead? “We expect 2025 to be another year of single-digit returns for the markets. Indian GDP growth has slowed and high-frequency indicators have moderated through the course of 2024 and while these are showing signs of bottoming out,” Vora said. In the interim, strong domestic inflows continue to support the Indian equity market and we do not see any major risk to this. Overall, we see low likelihood of valuation multiples rerating in 2025 and expect market returns to track or slightly lag earnings growth, he said. Further, Trump’s policies in the US are expected to influence the direction of the global markets and economy in the coming months. FPI holdings have reduced to 16 per cent in 2024 after peaking at 20 per cent during FY14-20. While India’s dependence on FPI inflows has reduced due to its strong domestic flows, FIIs continue to hold $800 billion in Indian equities and their continued selling remains a risk for the market, BNP Paribas said. Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed. The brothers Provit and Sorbojit Thaosen were among the victims, along with four others from their village. The incident highlights the lack of employment opportunities and low wages that force many from their villages to work as migrant workers.",

    "title": "Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on January 22",
    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Wednesday, tracking upbeat global market cues. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a positive start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,161 level, a premium of nearly 60 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Tuesday, the domestic equity market crashed, with the benchmark Nifty 50 falling near 23,000 level. TheSensexcracked 1,235.08 points, or 1.60%, to close at 75,838.36, while the Nifty 50 settled 320.10 points, or 1.37%, lower at 23,024.65. Nifty 50 formed a long bear candle on the daily chart that has engulfed the narrow range movement of the last six sessions on the downside. “The broader high low range of 23,400 - 23,050 is now on the verge of downside breakout. The previous opening downside gap of 13 January has weighed high on the market and that resulted in a sharp weakness,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the underlying trend has turned down sharply after a small upside bounce. The next lower support to be watched around 22,800 levels and any pullback rally could find strong resistance around 23,200 levels. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Nifty Open Interest (OI) data indicates the highest OI on the call side at the 23,200 and 23,300 strike prices, highlighting strong resistance levels. On the put side, OI is concentrated at the 23,000 and 22,800 strike prices, marking these as key support levels, said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking. Sensex plunged 1,235.08 points, or 1.60%, to close at 75,838.36 on Tuesday, with the BSE-listed companies erasing market capitalisation of₹7 lakh crore. “Technically, after a gap-up open, the market consistently faced selling pressure at higher levels. This led to the formation of a long bearish candle on the daily charts, and theSensexindex closed below the 76,000 support zone, which is largely negative. We are of the view that, as long as the market trades below 76,000, the weak sentiment is likely to continue,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. On the downside, the market could slip as low as 75,500. Further weakness is likely to continue, which could drag the market till 75,300. However, above 76,000, the market could bounce back, moving towards 76,400 - 76,500. The current market texture is volatile, and thus level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders, he added. Nifty 50 witnessed heavy selloff on January 21 and closed the day lower by 320 points. “Nifty 50opened on a positive note but faced selling pressure near its 14-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), closing with a long bearish candlestick just above the key support of 23,000 and below its consolidation range. The RSI, currently at 36 and in bearish crossover, indicates a bearish trend, suggesting room for further downside before entering the oversold zone and solidifying bearish dominance. Selling pressure continues to limit recoveries, and the follow-up move will be key to confirming further downside,” said Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. According to him, a close below 23,000 could push the index toward pre-election levels of 22,500, with immediate resistance at 23,300. Until Nifty 50 closes above 23,500, he recommends a sell-on-rise strategy. Om Mehra, Technical Analyst, SAMCO Securities, noted that the broader structure of lower highs and lower lows remains intact, indicating the continuation of the downtrend. “Nifty 50 also slipped below its 9-day EMA, suggesting weakening short-term momentum. The index’s falling intensity was highlighted by a sharp rise in volatility, as the India VIX surged 3.90% intraday, closing at the 17.06 level. Notably, the VIX spiked nearly 18% in January, signaling heightened market uncertainty. The daily RSI tilted further downward now hovering near the 35 level, reflecting diminishing strength. The support is positioned at 22,800 and the primary trend remains decisively bearish,” Mehra said. At this juncture, bottom fishing should be avoided as the market remains vulnerable. It is prudent to wait for clear signs of stabilization or reversal, he added. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, said that unless the Nifty 50 index crosses the 23,472 level, the bearish sentiment could prevail, especially as we approach the budget session. “On the technical charts, Nifty 50 can expect support near 23,090 and 23,000, and resistance levels can be found near 23,310 and 23,380 in the next session. Considering the current volatility and continued global uncertainty, market participants should remain cautious in the coming weeks and stick with a sell-on-rise approach,” Ambala said. Bank Nifty ended Tuesday’s session at 48,570.90, registering a decline of 779.90 points, or 1.58%, and formed a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, highlighting a mounting bearish outlook. “Although theBank Niftyindex attempted to move higher, the previous resistance levels proved to be stronger, and the index lost momentum. The broader structure of lower highs and lower lows remains intact, signaling the continuation of the downtrend. The index remains below key moving averages, suggesting persistent weakness in the short term,” said Om Mehra. The swing low remains at 47,898, and a break below this level could trigger further declines in the index. The immediate resistance remains at 49,500, which could limit any potential upward movement, he added.

    "title": "Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on January 23",
    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open lower on Thursday tracking mixed global market cues. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a negative start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 23,137 level, a discount of nearly 60 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Wednesday, the domestic equity market ended higher amid short covering, with the Nifty 50 closing above 23,150 level. TheSensexrallied 566.63 points, or 0.75%, to close at 76,404.99, while the Nifty 50 settled 130.70 points, or 0.57%, higher at 23,155.35. Nifty 50 formed a small positive candle on the daily chart with lower shadow. “Technically, this market action indicates an upside bounce from the lows. Though Nifty 50 closed higher on Wednesday, the overall market breadth deteriorated and the broad market indices have closed sharply lower. The negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms is still intact,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the underlying trend of Nifty 50 remains weak and the market seems to have shifted into a broader range of 23,000 - 23,400 levels. “A decisive move above the hurdle of 23,400 could open renewed buying participation in the market. However, a slide below 22,975 could open more weakness down to 22,800 ahead,” Shetti said. Derivatives data indicated the highest call open interest at the 23,300 and 23,500 levels, while the highest put open interest was at 23,000, highlighting a tightly contested trading range. Overall, the market sentiment remains positive as long as the Nifty sustains above its key support level of 23,100. A decisive breakout above 23,300 could trigger further upside momentum, said Mandar Bhojane, Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: Sensex witnessed a recovery from lower levels, and ended higher by 567 points on January 22. “For day traders, 75,850 would act as a crucial support zone. If theSensexstays above this level, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the higher side, the market could bounce back to the range of 76,700 - 76,900. Conversely, if it falls below 75,850 the sentiment could change below the same it could decline to 75,600 - 75,500,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. Nifty 50 showed high volatility with positive bias on January 22 and closed the day higher by 130 points. “Nifty 50index took support from the lower Bollinger band and bounced, owing to the HDFC results. The index also took support from the 23,000 level, which is the immediate support for the index. The index has formed an inverted hammer candle, indicating mild bullishness in the index, however, any bounce can be used to sell the index until the 23,800 level is not taken off. The momentum indicators are well below the oversold region, which can act as a reason for a bounce in the index from the current level,” said Dr. Praveen Dwarakanath, Vice President of Hedged.in. Options writer’s data for the January monthly expiry showed increased writing of the calls at the 23,000 and above levels, indicating a weakness still to continue in the index, he added. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, is of the view that the Nifty 50 can expect support near 23,050 and 22,950 with resistance at 23,370 and 23,410. Bank Nifty index gained 153.50 points, 0.32%, to close Wednesday’s session at 48,724.40, forming a Dragonfly Doji-like candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe. “Bank Niftytested its support at the 48,000 level, however, it bounced owing to the HDFC results today during the markets. The index has formed an inverted hammer candle, indicating mild bullishness in the index, however, one can sell the index on a bounce until the index manages to break the 49,600 level. The momentum indicators are in the oversold region, which can be a possible reason for a bounce in the index from the current level,” said Dwarakanath. Options writer’s data for the monthly expiry showed increased writing of the calls at the 49,000 level, suggesting a weakness in the index, he added.

On Monday, the domestic equity market indices cracked over a percent each, with the Nifty 50 drifting below 22,900 level. TheSensexcrashed 824.29 points, or 1.08%, to close at 75,366.17, while the Nifty 50 settled 263.05 points, or 1.14%, lower at 22,829.15. Nifty 50 formed a bearish candle on the daily frame and has been making lower lows from the last two sessions. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: The Indian stock market benchmark indices extended their losses, with the Sensex tanking by 824.29 points to close at 75,366.17 on Monday. “Technically, after a gap-down opening, the market consistently faced selling pressure at higher levels and formed a bearish candle on daily charts, closing below the 76,300 mark, which is largely negative. We believe that the current market texture is weak and volatile; therefore, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. The 76,300 level forSensexwill be key to watch, as long as it trades below this threshold, weak sentiment is likely to continue,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. According to him, on the downside, the market could slip to 75,200 - 74,800, however, if it rises above 76,300, the sentiment may change. Above this level, a pullback formation is likely to continue until it reaches 76,700 - 76,900. Derivatives data revealed the highest Nifty Call OI (Open Interest) at the 23,000 and 23,300 levels, indicating strong resistance in this range. Meanwhile, the highest put OI was concentrated at 22,500, suggesting a tightly contested support level. This highlights the cautious stance of traders amid the current market volatility, said Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Nifty 50 index dropped 263.05 points, or 1.14%, to close at 22,829.15 on January 27, forming a bearish candle on the daily timeframe. “Nifty 50 index has slipped from its recent consolidation on the daily chart, heightening pessimism across the Indian equity market. Sentiment is likely to favor bearish trades in the short term, particularly as long as theNifty 50index remains below 23,000. On the lower side, the prevailing weakness could potentially lead to a decline toward 22,500,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. Mandar Bhojane highlighted that on the technical front, the Nifty 50 broke down from a 10-day consolidation phase, closing near the critical support level of 22,800. “This indicates strong bearish momentum in the market. If the index sustains below 22,800, further corrections could take it towards the 22,500 and 22,200 levels. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen at 23,100 and 23,300, where the highest call OI is concentrated. Failure to breach these resistance levels could maintain the bearish trend,” said Bhojane. He believes the market remains under pressure, with bearish momentum dominating near-term sentiment, and advises investors to monitor key support and resistance levels closely, as a breach of 22,800 on the downside or a breakout above 23,100 could determine the next directional move. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, expects the Nifty 50 index to see support levels between 22,550 and 22,350 and face resistance between 22,800 and 22,930 in today’s session. Bank Nifty index plunged 303.15 points, or 0.63%, to close at 48,064.65 on Monday, forming a small-bodied candle on the daily scale with a long upper shadow as selling pressure was seen at higher zones. “Bank Niftyindex also opened with a gap down but showed buying interest near its previous swing low before closing negatively at 48,065. On the technical front, Bank Nifty found support near the recent swing low of 47,900. Sustaining above this level could pave the way for a pullback rally toward 49,000,” said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd. (A Pantomath Group Company). However, according to him, a breakdown below 47,900 may lead to further downside, with the potential to test 47,000 in the short term.

The Nifty 50 (.NSEI) , opens new tab and Sensex (.BSESN) , opens new tab have lost about 3% each in January, the second most in the four-month losing run.

They are now even below the levels in early June when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election victory sparked a rally to record highs. India's Nifty 50 on course for longest monthly losing streak in over 23 years The slide started in October as the quarterly earnings reports started coming in. About 60% of the Nifty 50 members posted results that either met or missed market estimates, their worst performance since March 2020, hurt by curbed government spending post-elections, above-normal rains and rising inflation.

The stronger dollar, elevated U.S. yields, tariff worries, sluggish domestic economic growth and high stock valuations will only drive more FPIs away, said Sanjeev Hota, vice president and head of research of wealth management at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

    "title": "Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on January 27",
    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open lower on Monday, tracking weakness in global markets. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a gap-down start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 22,932 level, a discount of nearly 180 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Friday, the domestic equity market indices ended lower amid profit booking, with the benchmark Nifty 50 slipping below 23,100 level. TheSensexdeclined 329.92 points, or 0.43%, to close at 76,190.46, while the Nifty 50 settled 113.15 points, or 0.49%, lower at 23,092.20. Nifty 50 formed a small negative candle on the daily chart with a long upper shadow. “Technically this market action signals rejection of bulls at the lower highs. The bearish pattern like lower tops and bottoms continued on the daily chart and Friday’s high of 23,347 could now be considered as a new lower top of the pattern. After the formation of a doji pattern in the previous week, the market was not able to show any significant upside bounce last week and closed lower by 0.5%. Hence, the bullish implication raised after the doji could be nullified,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the near-term trend of Nifty 50 remains weak and a slide below the immediate support of 22,975 levels could open the next downside towards 22,800 levels. Any upside bounce towards 23,350 - 23,400 could be a sell on rise opportunity, he added. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty today: In the last week, the benchmark indices continued to experience selling pressure at higher levels. The Sensex was down by 405 points. “Technically, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is holding a lower top formation on daily charts, which is largely negative. We believe that the current market texture is weak, but due to temporary oversold conditions, we could see range-bound activity in the near future,” said Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities. For the bulls, theSensexlevels of 77,000 and 77,300 will act as key resistance areas, while 75,700 and 75,500 could serve as key support zones for traders. If the market surpasses 77,300, it could rally till 77,800 - 78,000. Conversely, if it falls below 75,500 selling pressure may intensify, potentially slipping till 75,200 - 74,700, Athawale added. Nifty 50 continued with the downside momentum continued on January 24 after a small upside bounce of two sessions and closed the day lower by 113 points. “Nifty 50 remained volatile with a predominantly bearish bias. Sentiment continues to favor the bears as the index once again retreated from the day’s high. In the short term, the bears may maintain the upper hand as long as theNifty 50index fails to surpass the 23,450 level. Any rise toward the 23,350 – 23,450 zone is likely to encounter selling pressure. However, the downside may remain limited unless the 23,000 level is breached,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. VLA Ambala, Co-Founder of Stock Market Today, highlighted that on the weekly price charts, Nifty’s movement formed a high-wave candlestick pattern, mimicking investors’ indecisiveness. “The benchmark index is currently at its 50-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and almost 3% below its 20-month EMA. However, this gap is likely to be filled soon as the Nifty’s monthly RSI suggests it's still at its moderate level. Considering this situation, Nifty could gather support between 23,130 and 23,200 and face resistance between 23,940 and 23,870 in today’s market session,” Ambala said. Dr. Praveen Dwarakanath, Vice President of Hedged.in, said that the Nifty 50 formed an inverted red hammer candle, indicating weakness in the index to continue. “Nifty 50 index sold off during the day after a bounce from its immediate support at the 23,000 level. The momentum indicators are well below the oversold region, which can be a possible reason for the bounce, however, one can sell the index on every rise, until the resistance at the 23,800 level is not taken off,” said Dwarakanath. Options writer’s data for the January monthly expiry showed increased writing of the calls at the 23,100 and above levels, indicating a bearishness in the index, he added. Bank Nifty dropped 221.20 points, or 0.46%, to close at 48,367.80 on Friday, forming a high wave doji candlestick pattern, reflecting cautious sentiments. “Bank Niftyformed a red doji candle with the upper shadow bigger than the lower one, indicating selling pressure in the index. The immediate resistance for the index is at the 49,500 level, until which, one can sell the index on every rise. The momentum indicators are in the oversold region, which can be a reason for a small bounce, however, it would be an opportunity for fresh selling at higher levels,” said Dwarakanath. Options writer’s data for the monthly expiry showed increased writing of the calls at the 48,400 and above levels, suggesting a weakness in the index, he added. Amol Athawale said that for Bank Nifty, as long as it is trading below 49,000, weak sentiment is likely to continue and on the downside, it could fall to 47,500 - 47,200. “Conversely, if it rises above 49,000, it could bounce back to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or 49,500. Further upside may also continue, which could lift the index up to 50,000,” Athawale said.

    "title": "Nifty 50 gives zero returns in one year! Is the Indian stock market still overvalued?",
    "body": "Following a period of strong outperformance in the past 2–3 years, the Indian equity market has lagged behind its global counterparts in the last year, generating nearly flat returns. In fact, both Indian benchmarks - Sensex andNifty 50- have slipped nearly 2 per cent in last one year, giving negligible returns and raising concerns about stretched valuations in the Indian equity market. “Currently, the index trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 22–23 times, notably above its long-term average, while the price-to-book ratio hovers near 3.4 times and the dividend yield remains modest at approximately 1.3%. Moreover, India’s market-cap-to-GDP ratio has surpassed 139%, a level that typically signals limited upside unless earnings growth accelerates meaningfully,” said Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities. Srivastava further highlighted that the medium- to long-term outlook- of the Indian stock market remains favorable. Historically, theNiftyhas delivered compounded annual returns of 12–17 per cent, supported by India’s structural growth trajectory. India’s growth story is anchored in strong fundamentals rising consumption, digital innovation, and a young, skilled workforce. Government reforms i.e. recent GST 2.0, infrastructure expansion, and initiatives like Make in India and PLI are boosting industrial capacity According to Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, the key reason behind this underperformance has been sustained FII selling, driven by better opportunities in developed markets as well as in countries like China and Germany. “ The recent global market rally has been largely led by AI-related stocks—a theme where India has no direct large-scale players. As a result, most of the incremental flows have been directed towards the US and China. Additionally, corporate earnings in India have remained muted for the past few quarters, while valuations were not particularly attractive. However, valuations have now reached more comfortable levels, and the growth outlook appears promising, which could rekindle FII interest in the Indian market going forward,” Meena said. Seema Srivastava of SMC Global said that India’s long-term trajectory remains robust, despite short-term macro challenges. “With resilient domestic demand and improving corporate governance, it offers compelling opportunities for long-term investors seeking sustainable wealth creation,” she said. Srivastava further explained that themarketis not in a bubble, it is priced for perfection, and current valuations can only be sustained if earnings growth picks up, domestic consumption remains resilient, global monetary conditions ease, and broader sectoral participation improves. “In this scenario, maintaining investment discipline and focusing on carefully chosen stocks becomes essential to manage short-term market volatility,” she added.

    "title": "Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on September 25 after drop in global markets",
    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to extend losses for the fifth consecutive session and open lower on Thursday, tracking weakness in global markets. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a negative start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 25,071 level, a discount of nearly 40 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Wednesday, the equity market indices extended losses for the fourth consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 closing below 25,100 level. TheSensexdropped 386.47 points, or 0.47%, to close at 81,715.63, while the Nifty 50 settled 112.60 points, or 0.45%, lower at 25,056.90. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50, and Bank Nifty today: Sensex is holding a lower top formation on intraday charts, and on daily charts, it has formed a bearish candle, which is largely negative. “We are of the view that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 81,500 level. Below this,Sensexcould slip to 81,200 - 81,000. On the flip side, above 82,000, the pullback move could extend up to 82,300 - 82,500. The intraday market texture is volatile; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. Mayank Jain, Market Analyst, Share.Market said that the immediate resistance for Sensex is seen at 82,000 – 82,100, and a convincing move above this may propel the index toward 82,500. “On the downside, support lies at 81,200 – 81,000. Breaching this zone could bring 80,500 as the next test for market sentiment,” Jain said. Derivatives positioning reflects a cautious undertone, with call writers continuing to outpace put writers. “Fresh Nifty open interest (OI) addition of 1.12 crore contracts at the 25,500 strike has established this level as a formidable resistance ceiling. Conversely, significant Put OI of 1.14 crore contracts at 25,000 reinforces this band as immediate support. The concurrent buildup of positions on both sides at near-the-money strikes underscores the prevailing indecision, hinting at a likely range-bound phase,” said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) eased to 0.78 from 0.86, tilting sentiment slightly bearish and indicating sellers still maintain an edge. Nifty 50 formed a bearish candle with a lower high and lower low on the daily chart, indicating continued profit booking. “A reasonable bear candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weakness in the market with volatility. Though, Nifty 50 placed at the lows of 4 days decline, still there is no indication of any reversal pattern forming at the lows,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the short-term trend of the market continues to be negative.Nifty 50is now sliding down to the crucial lower support of 24,900 levels as per weekly chart. Immediate resistance is placed at 25,150. Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research), Centrum Broking Ltd. noted that the Nifty 50 has now completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 24,404 to the recent peak of 25,448, with the key level around 25,050. “A decisive move below this level could open the door for further downside towards 24,920, which coincides with the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as the 50% retracement of the recent uptrend. Despite the ongoing weakness, the broader structure remains positive as long as Nifty 50 holds above 24,900. On the upside, a breakout above 25,150 would invalidate the current bearish setup and may trigger a short-covering rally towards 25,300,” said Jain. Mayank Jain said that the immediate resistance for Nifty 50 is at 25,200 – 25,250, and a decisive break above this level may lift the index toward 25,350. Strong support is placed at 25,000 – 24,950, and if this zone breaks, then maybe 24,800 will act as the support. Bank Nifty slipped 388.25 points, or 0.70%, to close at 55,121.50 on Wednesday, forming a bearish candle, with the day’s high remaining much lower than the previous session’s high, reflecting a slight loss of positive momentum. “Bank Nifty has closed below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 55,270 and is now about to test the 38.2% retracement. Slipping below this level may drag the index further towards the 50% retracement near the 54,700 zone. On the higher side, 55,500 has become immediate resistance, and only a decisive close above this mark would alleviate the current pressure. On the hourly timeframe, Nifty Bank is consolidating around 55,100, with repeated rejections near the 55,300 levels,” said Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. The RSI has dropped to 51 on the daily chart and slipped near 40 on the hourly timeframe, reflecting a loss of strength. The daily MACD remains in positive territory. “The broader trend remains constructive above the 20-day moving average (DMA) at 54,620, but the near-term setup suggests extended consolidation with a downward trend. Unless Nifty Bank closes back above 55,500, the index may drift lower towards 54,800 – 54,600,” Mehra said. According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities, the 55,100 – 55,000 zone will act as an immediate support forBank Nifty, and a sustained move below 55,000 can lead to the throwback extending further in the Index towards 54,500. “On the upside, the zone of 55,500 - 55,600 is likely to act as an immediate resistance. Any follow through buying above this zone can lead to resumption of uptrend in the Index,” said Shah. Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivative Research, Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd. highlighted that the Bank Nifty index formed a red candle on the daily scale, signalling persistent selling pressure. “On the downside, immediate support is placed at 54,800, followed by 54,500. On the upside, the zone of 56,000 – 56,160 will act as a significant resistance. Hence, adopting a buy-near-support and sell-near-resistance approach is recommended in Bank Nifty for the short term,” said Yedve.

    "body": "Indian stock market:Indian equities began Monday’s session on a weaker note, extending the previous round of profit-taking, with IT stocks weighing the most after the U.S. sharply increased the one-time H-1B visa fee to $100,000 (₹88 lakh). The move dampened sentiment in a sector that had only recently begun to recover. At the opening bell, the S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.37 per cent to 82,323.62, down 302.61 points, while the NSENifty 50slipped 0.26 per cent to 25,260, losing 67.05 points. By around 9:30 AM, the Sensex was trading 182 points, or 0.22 per cent, lower at 82,443, and the Nifty50 was down 40 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 25,288. “Last week's achievement of the 25400-600 objective, along with an evening star candle formation prompts us to look for a pull back instead of extending upside objectives right away. Favoured rest point is 24880-800. However, should slippages not stretch beyond the 25200-25000 region, we could as well be seeing a sideways move, followed by recovery attempts, though an outright penetration of 25669 is less expected,” said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. TheNiftyindex displayed strong bullish momentum over the past week, advancing 213 points and forming a bullish candle, marking the third consecutive week of gains. According to Amruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst, Choice Broking, The index has held firmly above the 25,300 mark, closing at 25,327. Nifty continues to trade above its key moving averages—the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—further confirming the broader bullish undertone. “As long as the index remains above these moving averages, market sentiment is expected to stay constructive. On the upside, immediate resistance levels are seen at 25,500, followed by 25,600 and 25,850. On the downside, support is placed at 25,150 and then at 25,000, with a deeper breakdown below 24,900 likely to trigger additional downside pressure,” Shinde said. Support Levels:- 25150-25000 Resistance Levels:- 25600-25850 Overall Bias:- Sideways To Bullish BankNiftyended the week on a positive note, closing at 55,458.85 after recovering nearly 649 points during the week. The index has demonstrated resilience by sustaining above the 55,400 mark and closing in the green for the third consecutive week. “If the buying momentum continues and the index decisively crosses 55,750, it could pave the way for further upside towards 56,000 and 56,500 levels. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 55,000. A sustained breakdown below this level could trigger fresh selling pressure, with potential targets at 54,830 and 54,500,” Shinde said.

Part 30 exemptive program of CFTC provides U.S. customers with increased access to foreign futures markets,” the release added. CFTC is an independent agency of the U.S. government that regulates the futures and options markets and monitors various organisations related to derivatives clearing, futures commission merchants and swap data repositories among others. SEC recognition for BSE Incidentally, the development comes just days after the BSE becoming the first Indian exchange to be recognised as a Designated Offshore Securities Market (DOSM) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The DOSM status allows the sale of securities to U.S. investors through the trading venue of BSE without registration of such securities with the U.S. SEC and thus eases the trades by U.S. investors in India.",

    "title": "NSE applies for extending equity derivatives trading hours till midnight: Sources",
    "body": "The National Stock Exchange has written to capital and commodity market regulator SEBI, seeking approval to extend the time of equity derivatives trading till nearly midnight, sources told Moneycontrol. The NSE, India's top stock exchange, is looking to start a second trading session between 5:00 pm and 11:55 pm, only for equity derivatives, after the regular session ends at 3.30 pm. It is not clear whether trading will be held in single-stock derivatives or only index derivatives in the absence of a cash market during the second session. In May this year, SEBI hadallowed stock exchangesto hold trading in derivatives between 9 am and 11.55 pm. NSE accounts for about 90 percent market share in equity derivatives in India. The other major exchange, BSE, has not been known to have applied for an extension in trading times, even though both exchanges tend to align their trading sessions with each other. Currently, commodities exchanges such as MCX and NCDEX conduct trading in derivatives of some agri and non-agri commodities. Brokers saythey would resistany move to keep trading open till midnight, as they do not see enough business post regular trading hours to compensate for the additional operating costs they will have to incur. Plus there are also concerns on how effectively an equity derivatives market will work in the absence of a functioning cash market. A market participant told Moneycontrol, \"On the commodity side, SEBI is trying to connect the spot price to the futures price but there will be a disconnect on the equity side, which will close for trading at 3:30 pm.\" Many trades, such as hedging or arbitrage, require traders to initiate positions in both the cash and the derivatives market to work effectively. A source close to SEBI told Moneycontrol that the regulator had \"given the option\" to exchanges on the issue of extending trading times. \"Whether they want to increase it or not, it depends on the exchanges,\" the source said.

    "body": "An SGX sign is pictured at Singapore Stock Exchange July 19, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Singapore Exchange (SGX) said on Saturday a court-appointed arbitrator had told it to continue listing and trading SGX Nifty contracts beyond August 2018, during a dispute resolution with India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The two exchanges have been locked in dispute after India's three main bourses unexpectedly announced in February they would stop licensing their indexes to foreign bourses from August. SGX responded that it would launch successor products to its flagship Indian equity derivative products on June 4. Now NSE and SGX have been ordered \"to facilitate the continued listing of SGX Nifty products for at least two successive contract month maturations beyond the arbitration's completion date\", SGX said in a statement. The arbitrator has also asked SGX not to offer its proposed new India equity derivative products until the final decision, it said. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"Arbitration proceedings are continuing and the hearings on evidence are expected to commence in early 2019,\" the statement said. SGX had postponed the launch of a set of new India derivatives products after an Indian court in May referred a dispute around the proposed offerings to an arbitrator. In a statement issued on Saturday, NSE also confirmed the interim order of the arbitrator. The NSE had sought an interim injunction against the launch on grounds that the offerings infringed the intellectual property rights of its unit India Index Services and Products (IISL), which runs the Nifty index. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The Bombay High Court then asked a senior retired judge to arbitrate in the matter, and resolve the issue by June 16. However, the June 16 interim order, which was reviewed by Reuters, laid out a timeline for filing of claims and counter-claims and set Nov. 21 for hearing of the issues, with further directions to be provided on June 18. Over the past two decades, SGX has become the most popular market for foreign investors to bet on Indian equity indexes, with Nifty 50 futures SINc1 tracking the NSE's main index .NSEI.

The Indian government backed the decision, as it is keen to draw investors to an international financial centre being developed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's western home state of Gujarat, sources say.

The broader Nifty was up 0.24 percent at10,549.7 as of 0546 GMT, while the benchmark Sensex was 0.32 percent higher at 35,064.11. Primarily, a good set of corporate fundamentals is driving the buying and the recovery today, said Deven Choksey, founder, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

In India, Jaguar Land Rover-owner Tata Motors Ltd led the gains, rising as much as 5.4 percent to a four-week high after data from a UK auto trade association showed a surge in Jaguar registrations in October.--With inputs from agencies The Tata Harrier EV and Mahindra XEV 9e are new electric SUVs in India.

    "title": "Sebi begins probe into trading glitches at NSE and MCX",
    "body": "Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has started investigating last week’s technical glitches and trading halts at the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the Multi Commodity Exchange Ltd (MCX), two people aware of the matter said. “The regulator has sought a report from both the exchanges that have suffered technical glitches and trading halts for the second time within a year. Sebi will analyse the reports by the two exchanges and will respond in terms of corrective measures and actions,” said one of the two people quoted above. An email sent to a Sebi spokesperson was not answered. NSE was forced to halt trading for around three hours at the start of 10 July last year because of technical issues. On Thursday, it’s Neat on Web (NOW) systems suffered a software shutdown during trading hours. Normal trading was not disrupted as the members had alternative modes of connectivity during the disruptions. A spokesperson for NSE said, “NOW is a shared CTCL system which had a temporary disruption and has been rectified on the same day and the system was up and running. NSE trading platform is completely different and functioned smoothly with full efficiency that day.” MCX suffered a trading halt in September last year and a repeat occurred on Friday when trading was halted twice. The first time, the systems halted for more than an hour at 7:12 pm and a second time at 10:11 pm. Normal trading resumed at 11 pm. “Data integrity and other checks have been performed to satisfy and assure that there has been no impact on any of the surveillance, risk margining and any other pre or post-trade activities,” said MCX but declined to comment on a specific query. MCX’s preliminary analysis shows that there was some aberration in the low-level network layer but a detailed analysis of hardware and underlying operating systems is pending. “It is the frequency of trading disruptions that is worrying. While Sebi typically has not penalised exchanges for trading disruptions, it cannot be ruled out if it causes any loss to market sanctity,” said the second person quoted above. “There is certainly a need to strengthen the monitoring system. Sebi will ensure that there is a proper monitoring of the technology being dispensed and that no investor is put at loss due to disruption,” he said. Due to malfunction at NOW, thousands of orders placed by hundreds of brokers were repeated by the system a number of times and in some cases, hundreds of times resulting into unintended trades for brokers/clients. The Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) in a communication has even requested NSE for compensation as system fired multiple orders on its own, resulting in trades. “It was not a breakdown of trading, rather a malfunction which resulted in firing of multiple orders resulting in trades from NSE’s NOW system,” said ANMI in a communication to Sebi, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint. The Indian Council of Investors, an investor association, has also written to Sebi calling for unintended trades at NSE to be annulled. “Brokers/investors should not be made to face the adverse consequences and financial loss resulting from this system malfunction of NOW,” said the investor association in the letter.

    "title": "NSE to launch weekly options on Nifty index",
    "body": "ThinkStock Photos The weekly options of the Nifty index will have seven consecutive weekly expiry contracts excluding the week where monthly contracts expire. NEW DELHI: National Stock Exchange of India has secured permission from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to launch weekly options on the Nifty index. The launch of options contracts on the 50-stock index is likely to increase volumes in the option segment and provide a hedging tool to market participants. The exchange had launched weekly options on the Bank Nifty in 2016 and more recently, it had launched weekly options in the currency derivatives segment on the USD-INR currency pair. “With the successful launch of weekly options on the Nifty Bank index, there was demand from the market participants for a similar product variant of the NIFTY 50 index. The weekly options on Nifty50 index provides an additional hedging tool for market participants to manage the portfolio risk more effectively,\" said Vikram Limaye, MD & CEO of NSE . The NSE said that it is currently evaluating the readiness of market participants for the product launch and will announce a launch date shortly. Live Events The weekly options of the Nifty index will have seven consecutive weekly expiry contracts excluding the week where monthly contracts expire. \"It could push the volume and participation in options segment like in Bank Nifty weekly contracts, which is seeing huge participation. Already, index option segment has contribution of 90 per cent turnover in the total turnover of NSE F&O segment,\" said Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal. Taparia said traders could get opportunity to do pair trading in the Nifty and Bank Nifty weekly options. On expiry of a weekly contract, exchange will introduce next weekly contract on rolling basis. The existing three monthly options contracts, three quarterly and eight semi-annual option contracts will also continue to be available, said NSE. The contracts will expire on Thursday of every week. In case the Thursday is a trading holiday, the previous trading day will be the expiry/last trading day, said NSE. The exchange said that the strike interval for the weekly options will remain the same as monthly contracts. Rajesh Baheti, President of Association of National Exchanges Members of India believes that the weekly options on Nifty index will increase volume across the market but there could be a drawback in terms of higher liquidity in the weekly options contracts compared to the monthly options contracts. \"Liquidity on the monthly Nifty options contracts may go down if market participants start trading more in the weekly options,\" said Baheti. Baheti believes that unlike the Bank Nifty weekly options, the launch of Nifty weekly options will not lead to a significant increase in volatility as the Nifty is a broad based index while Bank Nifty is dominated mainly by two stocks.

    "title": "NSE IFSC to introduce trading in US Stocks",
    "body": "IFSC As one of the largest and fastest growing economies , India has been a major consumer of International financial services (IFS). The 2007 report of the committee set up by the Ministry of Finance (popularly known as the Percy Mistry Committee Report) had estimated that even under conservative assumptions, purchases by Indian households and firms of IFS will be nearly $50 billion by 2015, and could exceed $120 billion by 2025. Thus, with the objective of bringing back to India the international financial service business generated from India, and gradually emerge as an international financial services hub at the regional and global level, Government of India operationalized India’s maiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT Multi Services SEZ in April 2015. IFSCA The International Financial Services Centres Authority Act was passed in December 2019 and the IFSCA commenced its operation as a unified regulator in October 2020. The IFSCA has been vested with the combined powers of four domestic regulators namely RBI, SEBI, IRDAI and PFRDA and has a mandate to develop and regulate financial institutions, financial services, and financial products within the IFSCs in India. The strategic objectives of IFSCA are as follows: To position the IFSC as a leading internationally recognized centre with trusted business and tax regulation, and judicial & dispute resolution system. To become a gateway for global capital flows into and out of India. To emerge as a regional/global hub for international financial services. NSE IFSC to introduce trading in US Stocks NSE International Exchange has announced that trading in select US Stocks will soon be facilitated through the NSE IFSC platform. The offering will be in the form of unsponsored depository receipts. IFSCA has facilitated the same under the Regulatory Sandbox. The entire trading, clearing, settlement and holding of US Stocks will be under the regulatory structure of IFSC Authority, stated an official release here Monday. This initiative is a first-of-its-kind at IFSC where Indian retail investors will be able to transact on the NSE IFSC platform under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) limits prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it added. The business model offered by NSE IFSC will not only provide an additional investment opportunity to the Indian investors but also make the entire process of investment easy and low-cost. Investors will be provided with an option to trade in fractional quantity / value when compared to the underlying shares traded in US markets. The proposed framework will make US stocks affordable to Indian retail investors. NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation Limited (NICCL) is to offer its robust risk management framework, facilitate clearing and settlement of all trades in depository receipts and provide settlement guarantee in respect to all trades executed on the NSE IFSC platform. Furthermore, all the trades will be covered under the investor protection framework at NSE IFSC.

    "title": "NSE VS BSE | How NSE Beat BSE to Become India's Top Stock Exchange",
    "body": "Stock exchanges are the powerful platforms or marketplaces that allow us to invest or trade in securities. Most beginners in the stock market have a doubt regarding the exchange they should transact in— whether it should be BSE or NSE. In this article, we dive into the two prominent stock exchanges of India. We shall also analyse the factors that helped NSE become our country’s largest stock market exchange. TheBombay Stock Exchange(BSE) was established way back in 1875. Located in Dalal Street, Mumbai, it is the oldest stock exchange in Asia.There are more than 5,400 companies listed on the BSE. Its benchmark index, theS&P BSE Sensex, is widely tracked by investors across the globe. The Sensex (Sensitive Index) tracks the performance of 30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE. As of 2020,BSE is the 10th largest exchange in the worldin terms of the cumulative market capitalisation of all companies listed on its platform. TheNational Stock Exchange(NSE) was incorporated in 1992. It is also located in Mumbai. NSE is ranked the third-largest stock exchange globally in terms of the total number of trades in equity shares.There are more than 1,600 companies listed on the NSE. It is the first bourse in India to implementelectronic or screen-based trading. TheNifty 50is NSE’s benchmark index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest companies listed on its platform. Both NSE and BSE provide a platform for companies to raise funds efficiently.The exchanges allow investors to trade in equities, currencies, debt instruments, derivatives (F&O), and mutual funds. Moreover, they provide services such as risk management, clearing and settlement, and investor education. The exchanges operate under the strict guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). For more than a century, BSE had complete dominance over stock trading in India. To break this monopoly and improve transparency in the capital market, our government decided to create the NSE. It wasIndia’s first computer-driven stock exchangeand was promoted by some of the leading financial institutions at that time. NSE was given the right to set uptrading terminalsacross the country, while BSE was not allowed to do so. [Trading terminals are intermediary software that allows investors and traders to place buy/sell orders without having to call their brokers]. Meanwhile, it took a few years for BSE to receive permission for the same. Thus, NSE was able to capture a significant portion of share trading across India. They used state-of-the-art technologies to ramp up the performance of trading systems.NSE was the pioneer of automated and paperless trading in the Indian market. It set up the firstdepository— the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), which initiated the demat revolution in the country. NSE was also the first stock exchange to establish a clearing corporation (NSE Clearing Limited), which helps reduce trading and settlement risks in the market. With the arrival of NSE, investing and trading in stock markets became highly transparent, efficient, and less costly. Ever since NSE was established in 1992, there has been fierce competition between the two bourses for attracting more trading volumes. Higher volumes would ultimately allow exchanges to obtain more revenue. More importantly, it would lead to betterliquidity, an aspect that is vital while trading in shares and derivatives. Higher liquidity allows traders to quickly and easily buy or sell shares at the exact price specified by them. As a result of its revolutionary offerings,NSE has the highest average daily turnover for equity shares than any other stock market in India. The turnover for an exchange refers to the overall value of shares traded during a certain period. Let’s look at an example. On July 12, 2021, around 15.76 lakh shares of Reliance Industries were traded on the BSE. At the same time, ~39.6 lakh shares of RIL were traded on the NSE— more than double! Since NSE has high trading volumes, the price a buyer offers per share (bid price) and the price the seller is willing to accept (ask price) will be fairly close to each other. This helps intraday and swing traders enter and exit a trade at the exact price specified by them and realise their targets. For those who are not aware of whatderivatives tradingreally is, here’s a quick explanation: A derivative is an instrument whose value is derived from an underlying asset. The underlying can be a stock, commodity, index, etc. Derivatives are used by large institutions or traders to hedge risk and to speculate on price changes in the underlying asset. Futures and options (F&O) are the most common types of derivatives trading. An agreement (or contract) can be formed between a buyer and seller to buy/sell a predetermined quantity of the underlying asset at a specified price on a specified date. You can learn more about basic options termshere. Coming back to the point,NSE has always been the most liquid exchange for derivatives. It is the undisputed leader when it comes to futures and options (F&O) trading. This is clear when you compare the volumes (options chain) of F&O activated stocks on NSE and BSE. In most instances, there are zero contracts formed in BSE. On the other hand, NSE’s Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty are traded heavily in the stock market. Despite its exceptional growth, NSE lags behind BSE on one aspect: the brand. Sensex is still widely used across the world to measure the health of the Indian markets and the economy. To summarise, NSE is the preferred exchange for intraday, swing, and derivatives trading due to high liquidity. If you are a long-term investor, it does not really matter where you buy/sell shares. However, BSE gives access to more than 5,000 stocks across various sectors. There could be a minor/insignificant difference in the prices of scrips in NSE and BSE. The costs related to investing and trading are similar for both exchanges. Over the past few years, stock exchanges have come under the scanner due to frequent technical glitches. You may recall the four-hour-long halt in NSE’s trading system that occurred inFebruary 2021. The exchange informed that the instability of telecom links from two of its service providers had affected the functioning of its risk management system. Unfortunately, it resulted in heavy losses for investors. There was a complete lack of accountability from NSE. Recently, SEBI came out with a standard operating procedure (SOP) to curb technical glitches in stock market operations. NSE and BSE could face a penalty of up to Rs 2 crore or more if they fail to respond to technical disruptions within 30 minutes and restore operations within 45 minutes. Stock exchanges and other market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) will have to submit a root cause analysis report within 21 days of an accident. Let us hope such events do not occur in the future! Thanks for sharing such a good analysis Really a very good topic. Very good explanation. Honeykomb by BHIVE,19th Main Road,HSR Sector 3,Karnataka - 560102",

    "title": "NSE tech glitch: SEBI seeks explanation for not migrating to disaster recovery site",
    "body": "Markets regulator SEBI on Wednesday asked the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to explain why trading on the bourse did not migrate to a disaster recovery site after facing connectivity issues. NSE should carry out a root cause analysis of the reasons for the trading halt, a statement from SEBI said, adding that it was in constant touch with NSE officials all through the day and monitored the situation closely. Trading on NSE, India's largest bourse which handles over 90% of the volumes, came to a halt on Wednesday morning due to what the exchange termed as issues with telecom connectivity. Activity in some segments started facing glitches since around 10 am, within minutes of the markets opening at 0915 hrs, and all activity at NSE ground to a halt at 11.40 am. \"In view of the exceptional situation arising out of the trading halt, it was decided to extend the trading hours from 1530 hrs to 1700 hrs at NSE, BSE and MSEI,\" the SEBI statement said. The NSE should \"explain the reasons for trading not migrating to the disaster recovery site\" and asked it to submit a report at the earliest, according to an official statement. A disaster recovery system helps as a plan-B in times of distress to ensure that activity is not affected. Trading across segments was halted at 11.40 am on Wednesday due to \"issues with the links with telecom service providers\", according to the NSE. The bourse said it depends on two telecom service providers for connectivity, and both failed simultaneously resulting in the outage. \"The NSE was also advised to keep the market participants updated with the evolving developments,\" it said. In an unprecedented move, the bourses extended their trading hours till 5 pm as against the usual end of trade at 3.30 pm hrs, probably to make up for lost volumes. However, even after extended trading hours, the overall volumes could not touch the usual averages, NSE data showed. In the equities market, the value of securities traded on Wednesday stood at Rs 45,837 crore, as against an average daily turnover of Rs 72,472 crore in January in the cash segment. Similarly, in the equity derivatives segment, the total futures and options turnover stood at Rs 30.59 lakh crore on Wednesday, as against Rs 40.32 lakh crore on Tuesday. In June 2020, NSE's bank option segment prices were not reflecting on the terminal linked to the exchange. In September 2019 too, the bourse's system faced a trading outage as investors were unable to place orders in the final minutes of trade. Jimeet Modi, founder and chief executive at Samco Ventures, a brokerage, said there is a precedent of complete annulment of trades on Muhurat trading day on BSE Futures and Options segment in 2011. Commenting on Wednesday's outage, he said, \"The biggest question in this whole issue is why was the entire market shut just because index feeds were not refreshing? Feeds for underlying contracts were fine and so was order matching, so why shut down the entire market? \" \"SEBI and NSE need to quickly look at alternatives here if this isn't getting fixed,\" he added. Tata Communications and Bharti Airtel take care of NSE's connectivity. However, there was no statement from the companies. The NSE's 50-share benchmark Nifty gained 1.86% to close at 14,982 points on Wednesday. BSE's 30-share benchmark gained 2.07% to 50,781 points.",

    "title": "Glitch disrupts NSE trading for 4 hours in longest such outage",
    "body": "Stocks turned in dramatic gains of nearly 2% in a late surge on Wednesday, capping a turbulent day that saw trading on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), India’s largest, disrupted for nearly four hours because of a technical glitch. The outage, the longest such in the country, prompted NSE and its main rival BSE to extend trading hours until 5pm on Wednesday to allow investors to close their positions ahead of Thursday’s expiry of monthly derivatives contracts. Many investors couldn’t as brokerages squared off open positions to mitigate risks. NSEaccounts for 80% of India’s trading volume in derivatives. Also Read|India’s tricky options in the Myanmar muddle The first signs of a problem were noticed about an hour into trading at 10.06am as traders complained that NSE’s benchmark Nifty index, as well as the Nifty Bank Index, had stopped updating. After about an hour of confusion, at 11.40am, the exchange halted trading in all segments, including derivatives and cash, citing ‘issues’ with the telecom links of its two service providers, which it claimed caused the system to stop updating prices. As trading resumed at 3.45pm, in a special session, stocks surged, confounding investors with the sheer velocity of the rally. Analysts said the rally was prompted by investors and brokerages trying to square off trades. BSE continued normal trading in all segments through the extended trading day. After trading came to a halt on NSE, the exchange notified traders that it received communication from its telecom service providers that there are issues with their links. “We are working on restoring the systems as soon as possible. In view of the above, all segments have been closed at 11.40am and will be restored as soon as the issue is resolved,” an NSE spokesperson said in a statement in the afternoon. Brokers, however, were puzzled as to why trading could not be switched over to NSE’s backup site in Chennai and the unusual time taken by the exchange to communicate to investors. The backup site is a replica of the primary site and is aimed at ensuring trading activity does not stop even if there is a technical glitch. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has advised NSE to carry out a detailed analysis of the circumstances that caused the snag. Market participants and brokerages said NSE could have handled the situation better. Traders said those with open positions in the derivatives segment were on tenterhooks till NSE communicated about a resolution plan at 3.30pm. Many customers who trade in the futures and options (F&O) segment on NSE could not exit, and brokerages squared off positions by 4pm. “While the extended trading session helped many F&O customers exit their positions, it created confusion among customers whose positions had been squared off,” said Zerodha, an online brokerage with the highest number of retail clients. If NSE had informed brokers of a potential reopening or extension of trading hours, at least by 3pm, brokers would not have had to take risk-mitigation measures and square off positions on BSE, Zerodha said. “Unfortunately, because there were no updates, we had no other choice. The last-minute notification of the trading extension at 3:17pm came a little too late,” Zerodha said. Bharti Airtel, one of the telecom service providers to NSE, has received no communication from NSE, said a person aware of the matter. “Airtel is awaiting NSE’s RCA (root cause analysis) of the technical snag. Based on RCA, the company will move forward and respond accordingly,” said a person aware of the matter. The BSE Sensex rose 1,030.28 points, or 2.07%, to 50,781.69. The 50-share index Nifty gained 1.86% to 14,982. “Volumes on NSE were expectedly lower than the recent average. However, volumes on BSE at₹40,700 crore were the highest since March 2017, due to diversion of trades,” said Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities. “We have taken the matter seriously and have sought a report from Sebi at the earliest,” a finance ministry official said under condition of anonymity.

Within an hour of the stock market opening on 24 February, the first signs of trouble appeared. A little past 10 AM, the exchange feeds of the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) for its widely tracked indices, including the Nifty, stopped across brokerages. Trading continued for about 90 minutes on India’s premier stock exchange before it was abruptly halted. What followed was an unprecedented four-hour closure—the longest outage in NSE’s 29-year history. The chaos and confusion this unleashed was compounded by the lack of communication from the exchange until it was too late. The extended trading session announced just minutes before the market’s usual closing time was little comfort for many traders who had to suffer losses for no fault of their own. Their intraday positions on NSE had been closed by brokers on the rival BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) a few minutes earlier to prevent penalties, had NSE not re-opened for trading. The losses, outrage, and embarrassment the outage caused put NSE firmly on the backfoot. Even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that it cost the government “immensely”. The exchange blamed instability in telecom links and a vendor making inappropriate changes to technical equipment; these claims are being closely scrutinised. Written byAnand Kalyanaraman",

    "body": "In 2025, theUnion Budget, like every other year, will be presented on 1st February. However, this time around, it falls on Saturday, and markets are closed on the weekends. Let us look at the details. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has released a circular that communicated that it will conduct a special session on Saturday, February 1, 2025, on account of the presentation of the Union Budget.The exchange will follow the standard market timing, which means a pre-open session to be held from 9:00 am to 9:08 am. After this, the market will remain open for trading from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. It is a settlement holiday. It means that a T+0 settlement will not take place. No, this is not the first time exchanges will remain open when Union Budget Day fell over the weekend. In 2020, the exchanges conducted a live trading session on Saturday, February 1. Similarly, on 28 February 2015 (Saturday), the market remained open due to the presentation of the Union Budget. Here are some reasons why exchange keeps the market open: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget for the eighth consecutive year. The Department of Economic Affairs, under the Finance Ministry, prepares the annual budget, showcasing the nation’s economic strengths. Additionally, the budget outlines the government’s plans for expenditure, taxation, and welfare initiatives. On February 1, 2024, FM announced theinterim Union Budget. The Nifty 50 ended lower by 0.13%. On July 23, 2024, the final Union Budget was announced by Nirmala Sitharaman. The Nifty 50 ended the session 0.12% lower after a volatile session. Conducting a special trading session is not new. Exchanges have historically opened for special trading sessions during significant events like Budgets or major economic announcements, maintaining consistency in market operations.

    "body": "While most of the world welcomes the New Year with a laid-back holiday mood, sipping coffee and lounging in pyjamas, the Indian stock markets seem to march to a different beat. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) are operating as usual on January 1, 2025, despite it being New Year’s Day. Unlike many international stock markets that observe January 1 as a holiday, Indian stock exchanges are open for trading today. The official holiday calendar issued by NSE India does not include New Year’s Day as a non-trading day. Consequently, trading activities began at their regular times, with the pre-open session starting at 9:00 am and the full-day trading session running from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. Investors can carry out their transactions just like on any other regular trading day. In India, the stock markets operate from Monday to Friday and remain closed on weekends, i.e., Saturdays and Sundays. The pre-open session, which allows for price discovery and order matching, begins at 9:00 am and lasts until 9:15 am. The main trading session runs from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. Yes, US stock markets are closed today, January 1, 2025, in observance of New Year’s Day. According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, trading will resume on January 2. On December 31, US markets closed early to allow traders to welcome the New Year. Additionally, the US stock markets will remain closed on January 9, 2025, for a national day of mourning to honour former President and Nobel Laureate Jimmy Carter. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is also closed today for New Year’s Day. Trading will resume on January 2, 2025. The LSE’s next scheduled closure will occur on April 18, 2025, for Good Friday. Several key international indices, including the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Euronext Paris, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Shanghai Stock Exchange, are observing a holiday today.

    "body": "Are the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) closed today on account of New Year’s Day? No, they are not. The benchmark indices of the Indian stock markets – Sensex and Nifty 50 – are operating as usual today, January 1, 2025. There is no trading holiday today. As per the official holiday calendar issued by NSE India, New Year’s Day, which falls on a weekday, is not listed among the non-trading days. This means that the pre-open trade will begin at the usual time of 9:00 am, and the markets will commence the day’s trading at the fixed time of 9:15 am. The markets will conclude the day’s trading with the 3:30 pm closing bell. What are the timings of Indian stock markets? The stock markets in India operate on five weekdays – Monday to Friday – and remain closed on weekends, i.e., Saturday and Sunday. The trading hours for the benchmark indices are from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. On all regular trading days, the pre-open session is held between 9:00 am and 9:15 am. Are the US stock markets closed today? Yes, the US stock markets will not operate today on account of New Year’s Day. According to an official communication by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the US stock markets will begin trading for 2025 on January 2. Trading concluded early on December 31. After the January 1 holiday, the US stock markets will remain shut on January 9 to observe a national day of mourning for the demise of former US President and Nobel Laureate Jimmy Carter. Will the London Stock Exchange remain closed today? Like the US stock markets, the London Stock Exchange will also remain closed today. As per available data, the next scheduled closure of the LSE will be on April 18, 2025, on account of Good Friday. Other key international indices, such as the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Euronext Paris, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Shanghai Stock Exchange, will also remain closed today.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 40.7, trending downward, indicating bearish momentum.

    "body": "Amid the market downturn, a break on Dalal Street might have been welcomed, but the BSE and NSE holiday schedules indicate otherwise. India prepares to celebrate festivals like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Lohri on January 14. Many traders and investors are wondering whether the stock markets will remain closed for the festivities. However, according to the official holiday calendar released by the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the stock markets will remain open on this day. Despite the holiday mood across the country, January 14 is not listed as a trading holiday, meaning that both exchanges will operate as usual. Trading in equities, derivatives, bonds, commodities, and currencies will take place during regular market hours from 9.15 AM to 3.30 PM. The holiday schedules for the BSE and NSE are determined based on national holidays and key religious and cultural festivals that are widely observed across the country. While Makar Sankranti and Pongal are celebrated in many states, they are considered regional holidays and do not feature on the official list of trading holidays. For 2025, the BSE and NSE have announced a total of 14 holidays when the markets will remain closed. These include major festivals such as Diwali, Holi, and Eid, as well as national observances like Independence Day and Republic Day. However, regional festivals like Pongal, Ugadi, and Onam typically do not qualify for market holidays unless they coincide with other national events. While the stock markets will remain open, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has declared January 14 as a bank holiday in select states for Makar Sankranti and Pongal. This means that banking operations such as cheque clearing and branch services may be unavailable in some regions. Customers are advised to check with their local banks for specific details. Here is the complete list of trading holidays for the Indian stock markets in 2025: February 26: Mahashivratri March 31: Eid-Ul-Fitr (Ramzan Id) April 10: Shri Mahavir Jayanti April 14: Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti April 18: Good Friday May 1: Maharashtra Day August 15: Independence Day August 27: Ganesh Chaturthi October 2: Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti October 21: Diwali (Laxmi Pujan) October 22: Diwali (Balipratipada) November 5: Prakash Gurpurb (Guru Nanak Jayanti) December 25: Christmas",

    "body": "ETMarkets.com Indian stock markets open higher on Makar Sankranti. Indian stock markets will remain open on Tuesday, January 14, the day celebrated as Makar Sankranti . All segments, including equity, derivatives, and SLB, will operate as usual. Additionally, the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) will also remain open for both the morning and evening sessions. The BSE and NSE holiday calendars consist of 14 days throughout the year when trading will be suspended on both exchanges. Next, and the first market closure of the year will be on February 26th, on account of Mahashivratri. Trading holidays are distributed throughout the year as follows: February, May, November, and December each have one; March and August have two each; and April and October have the most, with three each. In addition to the holiday, it should also be noted that the stock market will remain open on February 1, on the Budget Day, in order to ensure investor access and timely reactions to Budget announcements. Trading hours on February 1 are expected to follow the regular market timings to ensure a smooth operation.

April will see three holidays: Shri Mahavir Jayanti on April 10th, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14th, and Good Friday on April 18th. Maharashtra Day will be observed on May 1st, resulting in a market holiday. Several public holidays in 2025 coincide with weekends. Republic Day (January 26th), Shri Ram Navami (April 6th), and Muharram (July 6th) all fall on Sundays, while Bakri Id falls on Saturday, June 7th. Since these dates already fall on non-trading days, they do not impact the stock market's operational schedule. On Tuesday, domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty50, opened higher, rebounding from seven-month lows in the previous session, driven by gains in banking, auto, and energy stocks. The BSE Sensex rose 372 points, or 0.49%, to 76,711, while the Nifty50 gained 120 points, or 0.52%, trading at 23,206 around 9:21 am.

    "title": "Best Gaming Stocks in India",
    "body": "India has become the biggest gaming market in the world, with 9.5 billion gaming app downloads and 568 million gamers in the past few years. This growth is fueled by advancing IT infrastructure, widespread use of mobile devices and high-speed internet connectivity. Moreover, the incorporation of technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and the metaverse into console and computer games is also contributing to this expansion. With such a massive user base, it is no surprise that investors are eyeing the gaming sector for potential opportunities. In recent years, the gaming industry in India has transformed significantly, with a surge in online gaming participation across the nation. From casual gaming on mobile devices and PCs to organised esports tournaments and leagues, India is witnessing an unprecedented rise in gaming culture. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the expansion of broadband connectivity in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, along with affordable data costs and smartphones, which have made gaming more accessible to a diverse audience. In 2022, the Commonwealth Esports Championship marked a significant milestone, showcasing the global recognition of esports, exemplified by the Indian DOTA 2 squad's remarkable achievement of a bronze medal. By 2023, India's online gamer community surged to 442 million, making it the world's second-largest gaming user base, trailing only behind China. Furthermore, the Indian government has undertaken several initiatives to promote the growth of the gaming industry. It includes amendments to the Information Technology Rules of 2021 to regulate online gaming and protect gamers from harmful content and addiction. Additionally, the establishment of the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, and Comics (AVGC) Promotion Task Force aims to enhance domestic capabilities and foster the growth of the AVGC sector through the creation of a National AVGC policy. Furthermore, the government's authorisation of 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gaming sector presents opportunities for both domestic and foreign investors to contribute to the industry's expansion. However, the gaming market in India is estimated to reach USD 7.24 billion by 2029, driven by a CAGR of 15.68% from 2024 to 2029.

These factors are as follows: Assessing the potential of new and innovative game concepts is essential. Investing in promising new ideas with good initial funding can increase the chances of commercial success and higher returns on investment. So, keep an eye out for unique concepts that have the potential to capture the market's attention. Before investing in gaming stocks, it is crucial to evaluate both the leadership and management teams of gaming companies and their ethical conduct. Assess the leadership team for their industry experience and track record of success. Look for companies known for ethical practices to align investments with integrity and minimise risks. Consider the current valuation of a gaming company. Make sure it aligns with its financial performance and growth prospects. This helps you determine if the investment is justified. The gaming industry in India is competitive. To succeed, you need to assess a company's competitive position compared to its peers. Look at factors like product offerings, customer base, and pricing to understand how it stacks up against the competition. When thinking about investing in the gaming industry, be mindful of regulatory and legal risks. Changes in gaming laws or regulations can impact the industry, so it is crucial to invest in companies that are well-versed in the regulatory environment. Laws related to privacy and data protection can significantly affect the industry's revenue potential. Evaluating a gaming company's financial performance is crucial. You must look at factors like revenue growth, profit margins andcash flowto identify financially stable companies with growth potential. Before investing in gamingstocks, understand the obstacles and risks that the Indian gaming market might face as it grows. One big challenge is dealing with rules and regulations, especially when it comes to data privacy laws. This can be tough because India is still catching up with global standards. Moreover, the fact that software patents are not allowed makes it hard for companies to innovate, especially those making digital products. They need to protect their software code within the laws that already exist. Additionally, adhering to diverse compliance rules can be costly and hinder growth, particularly for new firms. Even though gaming stocks seem promising, knowing about and dealing with these challenges is crucial before investing. If you are planning to invest in gaming companies in India, be assured of their potential. With ample growth prospects and impressive revenue generation, now is a prime opportunity to consider investing in gaming stocks.

    "title": "Is the NSE IPO coming Soon? A Comprehensive Overview",
    "body": "The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) is planning an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO will be a book-built issue, with 11.14 Cr shares being offered to the public, as per its DRHP dated 28 December 2016. The shares will be offered in the following categories: Qualified Institutional (maximum 50%), Non-Institutional (minimum 15%), and Retail Individual (minimum 35%). The dates, issue size and price band for the IPO are yet to be announced. The company reapplied for the market regulator's approval in August 2024, but the Indian market regulator has yet to provide a valid justification for withholding permission for the IPO. NSE holds a dominant position in the Indian capital market and equity derivative segments. It has a 92.7% market share in cash equities, 99.9% in Equity Futures, and 96.9% in Equity Options. NSE is the world's largest derivatives exchange by trading volume and the third-largest in cash equities by the number of trades. The exchange also provides co-location facilities for high-volume and high-frequency traders. Between 2019 and 2024, NSE demonstrated remarkable financial growth, with sales growing more than fivefold from ₹3,027.79 crores to ₹16,433.61 crores and net profits soaring more than fourfold from ₹1,708.04 crores to ₹8,305.74 crores. The company’s profit before tax also surged from ₹2,576.21 crore in FY19 to ₹11,184.28 crore in FY24. NSE has achieved this growth while maintaining an asset-light business model and avoiding reliance on debt. By FY24, its total assets had grown significantly to ₹65,464 crore from ₹19,978 crore in FY19. A major portion of its revenue, 73.8%, comes from transaction charges, followed by 5.4% from co-location charges and 10.79% from other fees, underscoring its strong and diversified revenue streams. Recently, NSE has faced several legal challenges related to co-location, dark fibre, corporate governance, conflict of interest, trading access point (TAP), and interoperability. However, Nuvama Institutional Equities stated that NSE is on track to overcome these issues. SEBI recently disposed of a show cause notice against NSE and its former executives in the co-location case due to insufficient evidence. The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) dismissed SEBI’s appeals on corporate governance and conflict of interest matters in July. NSE also settled SEBI's probe into TAP system violations by paying Rs 6.43 billion in September 2024 and resolved interoperability non-compliance issues by paying Rs 271.3 million in November 2023. As of January 13, NSE is trading at Rs 1,800 per share in the unlisted market. The unlisted shares are currently quoted at Rs 7,300 per share on WWIPL (Wealth Wisdom India Private Limited). In November 2024, NSE issued four bonus shares for every one share held, resulting in a subdivision of shares. Key domestic investors in the NSE include Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), which holds a 10.72% stake, Stock Holding Corporation of India, which holds a 4.44% stake, and Radhakishan Damani (who owns a 1.6% stake). SBI Capital Markets holds approximately 4.4%, while the State Bank of India (SBI) owns 3.23%. The Indian economy is rapidly growing, and the increasing digitization and formalization of the economy are projected to drive growth in the financial sector. NSE is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with its innovative products and services. The surge in retail investor participation also points to a demand for new offerings.

    "title": "NSE adds 10 million investors in 5 months, surpasses 110 million mark",
    "body": "It took 14 years since the NSE's commencement of operations in 1994 to reach 10 million investors. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday said its unique registered investors have crossed the 11 crore mark, with the latest 1 crore addition taking place in just five months, reflecting investor participation in the stock market through direct means. Investor registrations at the NSE have experienced a remarkable acceleration in recent times, with a 3.6 times jump in the last five years. It took 14 years since the NSE's commencement of operations in 1994 to reach 1 crore investors. The pace then quickened, with the next 1 crore registrations taking about seven years, followed by another 3.5 years for the next crore and the subsequent milestone of adding the fourth crore took just over a year. \"The rate of growth has since quickened significantly, with each additional 1 crore investors being added in roughly 6-7 months, while the last 1 crore investors were added in just over five months, reflecting a shift in investor enthusiasm and participation in the stock market through direct means,\" NSE said in a statement. In the last five months, daily new unique investor registrations have consistently ranged between 47,000 and 73,000. This growth has been driven by several key factors, including the rapid advancement of digitisation, heightened investor awareness, financial inclusion efforts, and strong market performance. In 2024, the Nifty 50 index delivered a return of 8.8 per cent while the Nifty 500 index saw an impressive 15.2 per cent gain. Indian markets have had positive returns for the past nine consecutive years. \"As the new year begins, India's capital markets have achieved a significant milestone, with the number of registered investors at NSE exceeding the 11-crore mark. This rapid growth, with over one crore new investors added in just five months since crossing the 10-crore mark in August, reflects rising confidence of the Indian public in the stock market as a trusted avenue for wealth creation,\" Sriram Krishnan, Chief Business Development Officer at NSE, said. With this, the total number of client codes (accounts) registered with the exchange stands at 21 crore. This includes all client registrations done till date. Notably, clients can register with more than one trading member. Krishnan said that factors such as enhanced digital accessibility, increased investor education, and government initiatives promoting financial inclusion have driven this surge. Additionally, a younger, tech-savvy population and growing awareness of the benefits of equity investments have further accelerated this trend. Investor growth has also expanded beyond the urban centres, with all but 30 pin codes in the country having investors registered with the exchange, implying a coverage of 99.84 per cent in the country. In terms of geography, Maharashtra leads with 1.8 crore registered investors, followed by Uttar Pradesh at 1.2 crore, and Gujarat at 98 lakh and these three states account for 36.6 per cent of the 11 crore investors.

    "body": "Defence stock jumps 278% upon relisting on NSE and BSE after 1.5 years by Trade Brains | January 21, 2025 11:38 am During Tuesday’s trading session, the shares of India’s largest shipbuilding and heavy fabrication company in India hit a 5 percent upper circuit at Rs. 39.66 on BSE, after the company’s relisting on the Indian stock exchanges—BSE and NSE—after a gap of 1.5 years. With a market cap of Rs. 209 crores, the shares of Swan Defence and Heavy Industries Limited opened in the green at Rs. 39.66, as compared to its previous closing price of Rs. 37.78. Stock Relisting Details Swan Defence and Heavy Industries Limited was relisted on the BSE and NSE on Monday, 20th January 2025, marking its return to trading after 1.5 years. The stock opened at Rs. 35.99 on BSE and climbed 5 percent to hit the upper circuit limit of Rs. 37.78 on Monday’s trading session. On 17th January, the company announced that trading of its shares would resume from 20th January. Commenting on the relisting, the Director of SDHI stated: “ The resumption of trading in Swan Defence and Heavy Industries shares marks the beginning of a new journey for the shipyard. Our vision is to establish the shipyard as a globally renowned centre of innovation and craftsmanship, playing a pivotal role in elevating India’s standing amongst the world’s top shipbuilding nations. ” Scrip Code – 533107 , Symbol – SWANDEF Related Updates The company’s relisting aligns with its recent rebranding initiatives. Earlier this month on 2nd January, Swan Energy announced that its acquired entity, Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd (RNEL), had been renamed Swan Defence and Heavy Industries Ltd (SDHI). This move follows Swan Energy’s acquisition last year of the former Reliance Naval & Engineering, previously part of the Anil Ambani group. With this acquisition, Swan Energy aims to establish itself as a key private player in India’s naval defence sector and the construction of oil & gas vessels. As part of the restructuring, RNEL’s old shares were converted into SDHI shares at a conversion ratio of 275 RNEL shares for one Swan Defence share. The total equity structure includes 26.81 lakh shares held by the public, alongside 5 crore additional shares issued to Hazel Infra, the acquirer through the NCLT process, resulting in a total equity of Rs. 52.68 crore. About the Company Swan Defence and Heavy Industries Limited (SDHI) is India’s largest shipbuilding and heavy fabrication company strategically located on the west coast of India. It is a key private player in commercial & defence shipbuilding, ship repairs, and heavy fabrication in India.

    "body": "ETMarkets.com Indian stock market: Markets to remain open on Budget Day, allowing investors to respond instantly to key policy announcements, tax reforms, and economic measures impacting various sectors. The Indian stock market will remain open for a special trading session on Saturday, February 1, 2025, as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union Budget 2025-26, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE confirmed in a circular issued Monday. The exchanges will conduct a full trading session on Budget Day, following regular market hours, with equity trading from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM and commodity derivatives trading until 5:00 PM. However, the T+0 settlement session will remain suspended due to the settlement holiday. The move aligns with past practices when markets opened on Saturdays for budget announcements, notably in 2020 and 2015. The decision ensures investors can react in real time to fiscal policy measures, tax reforms, and sectoral allocations that often drive market movements. Pre-market trading will take place from 9:00 AM to 9:08 AM, while benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex will update live throughout the session. The Union Budget remains a pivotal event for markets, setting the economic agenda for the year ahead. With the government’s fiscal roadmap under scrutiny, market participants will parse the announcements for cues on growth, taxation, and sectoral incentives, shaping investment sentiment in the weeks to follow.

Stock market indicates oversold level Analysts and investors will closely monitor Sitharaman’s proposals, with infrastructure, banking, manufacturing, and healthcare stocks expected to see heightened volatility based on policy announcements. Historically, the Union Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, in 2017, then-Finance Minister Arun Jaitley advanced the date to February 1, allowing the government additional time to implement policies within the financial year. Since then, the Union Budget has been presented on February 1 annually. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will deliver the Union Budget for fiscal year 2025-26 on February 1, marking her eighth consecutive budget presentation. The most recent full-fledged Union Budget was presented by Sitharaman on July 23, 2024, following the Lok Sabha elections.

    "title": "Stock Market Holiday 2025: Is Trading Open On BSE, NSE On Budget Day, February 1st?",
    "body": "Stock Market Holidays 2025: One of the biggest events of the financial year 2025-26 is arriving on February 1st, when the Government of India will declare receipts, expenditures and many reforms to drive the economy's growth. This is called Union Budget! Right from the common man to taxpayers and India Inc., all have high hopes for Budget. Since 2017, the Finance Minister of India has been declaring the Union Budget of the country on February 1st every year. Will the stock market be open on the coming Budget day? Stock Market Holidays: The February 1st Budget announcement falls on a weekend, namely Saturday. And weekends are by default stock market holidays. Hence, trading in equities, equity derivates, derivatives, commodities, bonds, forex and other market related instruments will be closed on Saturday, February 1, 2025. Notably, this is the second time February 1st has fallen on Saturday since 2017, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The last Budget that was presented on a Saturday was on February 1, 2020, right after nationwide band due to the coronavirus. What Is a Union Budget? India's Union Budget is known as the annual financial statement under Article 112 of the Constitution of India. This annual budget is announced every financial year since Republic Day in 1950 which marked the constitution of the country. The annual Budget includes revenues and capital expenditure targets that the government could spend or predict to earn during that financial year. During the annual budget, the Finance Minister announces key reforms and policies that could drive consumption, investment and income of citizens and companies. That being said, the annual budget aims to drive the economy in that respective fiscal than compared to the previous year. What Market is expecting from Budget 2025? Chandraprakash Padiyar, Senior Fund Manager at Tata Asset Management said, that late 2024 and ongoing in 2025 is a clear trend of global capital moving towards the US economy. US$ has appreciated against all currencies sharply. With the new President in the US promising further protectionism, every economy in the world needs to focus on its strong points and look more internally. Fiscal discipline along with other macro parameters would be critical in these times. Padiyar added, \"India has done very well over the past few years on improving fiscal health and the government has articulated its target to achieve below 4.5% deficit for FY26E. Additionally, the Finance Minister articulated the target to reduce debt to GDP sharply beyond FY27. It would be prudent to continue to walk the path of fiscal consolidation and reduce debt to GDP ratios for the country which will go a long way in sustaining growth in the long term.\" While Sarvjeet Singh Virk, Co-founder & MD, Shoonya by Finvasia said, \"I am keen to see how Budget 2025 drives economic growth and inclusivity through key reforms. Reducing long-term capital gains tax, extending retail tax exemptions, increasing FDI limits, and promoting green bonds and startups through tax breaks would help attract capital and foster innovation. Standardizing KYC processes for Ease of Doing Business (EODB) and incentivising first-time investors in the capital market can also significantly enhance financial inclusion and encourage broader participation in India's economic growth. GIFT City's IFSC and enhancements to the Retail Direct Scheme would strengthen India's position as a global financial hub - an opportunity I believe we shouldn't miss out on.\" Virk further said, \"Past budgets have focused on privatization, modernization, and reforms across PSUs, railways, defense, agriculture, and GST to drive growth and improve efficiency. Continued advancements in these sectors to simplify compliance, reduce tax evasion, and enhance Public Digital Infrastructure is the need of the hour to boost growth and improve tax efficiency. With an FY26 fiscal deficit target of -4.5% of GDP, emphasis on capex, job creation, MSME support, and rural housing aligns with a long-term vision to achieve developed nation status by 2047, positioning India for sustained global leadership.\" How Stock Market Is Expected To Perform In The Week Ahead? Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group said, the coming week promises to be eventful for the Indian equity market, with key macroeconomic data and important corporate earnings reports set to shape market sentiment. The Master Trust Group highlighted the following key events that could stir market sentiments in India: - On Monday, January 27, China's NBS Composite PMI for January will provide insights into the performance of China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector health. On Tuesday, January 28, the U.S. Durable Goods Orders for December will offer clues about discretionary spending at the consumer level, followed by Japan's Consumer Confidence for January on Wednesday, January 29. - On Thursday, January 30, the U.S. Federal Reserve's Interest Rate Decision will be announced, which is expected to remain at 4.5%, along with the U.S. GDP Growth Rate for Q4, which is forecasted at 3.1%. These releases will provide essential information on economic growth and monetary policy. - On Friday, January 31, key U.S. data will be released, including the Core PCE Price Index MoM for December measuring the price change in goods and services purchased by consumers and UK Nationwide indicating trends in UK house prices. Singhania said, \"The interplay of rising inflation, global price trends, and corporate performance will be crucial for market participants. Robust performances from these corporate heavyweights could catalyze positive investor sentiment, while any earnings misses may exacerbate market volatility. \" The technical market outlook: Nifty 50 Outlook: Singhania said the NIFTY index ended the week with a 0.48% decline, marking its third consecutive weekly loss. It trades below critical support levels, including the horizontal zone and ascending trendline, as well as the 21 EMA, 55-week EMA, and 200-day EMA, confirming a downtrend. The resistance zone at 23350-23450 continues to cap any upward momentum, signalling strong selling pressure. The current technical structure supports a \"sell on rise\" strategy until the index sustains above 23450. The market may target 22850 and 22600 on the downside. However, a breach above 24450 could signal a potential recovery toward 23750. Traders should remain cautious, as technical setups indicate a bearish bias persists, he added. Indian stock market will react to the budget 2025 announcement on February 3rd, 2025. FM Nirmala Sitharaman will present her eighth Budget for India. Stay Informed with GoodReturns",

    "body": "Union Budget 2025:Union Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1, which falls on a Saturday. Typically, the stock market is closed on Saturdays, as the trading days are Monday to Friday. However, in view of the budget, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) have announced that the stock markets will be open on the day of the budget. On this day too, trading will be done like normal days. Notably, this is not the first time such an occurrence has happened. The markets were also open on February 1, 2020, and February 28, 2015, when the Union Budget was presented. According to the news, a special trading session will be held on Saturday for the Union Budget 2025. The equity markets will operate from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm, while the commodity derivatives markets will extend their trading hours until 5:00 pm.

According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE’s stock market holiday calendars, trading on the BSE and NSE will be operational as usual today, indicating that today is not a stock market holiday.

    "title": "Share Market Timings in India",
    "body": "Last Updated: 26 Sep 2025 To effectively trade or invest in the financial markets, you need to have the proper knowledge about the stock market timings in India. All over the country, theshare markettimings are the same. Therefore, once you get to know what the stock market timings are, you can buy, sell, or invest in shares from any part of the country during that time. These timings are also the same whether you want to trade on any of the two major stock exchanges in India, namely the BSE and the NSE. The regular market trading hours are from 09:15 AM to 03:30 PM. There’s a pre-opening session before 09:15 AM and a post-closing session after 03:30 PM, conducted after India stock market hours. Here is the Indian stock market opening time and closing time, along with the sessions that take place during the course of the day. used to evaluate buy and sell orders to determine the opening price. The pre-opening session starts at 09:00 AM and goes on till 09:15 AM. It’s further divided into three sections. During one of these time slots, you can place orders to buy or sell shares for a limited period. Let’s look at the details of the pre-opening session below. You can use these 8 minutes to place an order to buy or sell various shares on the stock market. You can also change or cancel any orders you have placed. Once the regular market starts at 09:15 AM, the ones executed during this part of the pre-opening session take priority in the queue of orders. You can’t place new orders, change existing orders or cancel orders during these 4 minutes. This section is required to carry out price matching by comparing supply and demand. It is used to calculate the prices at which various shares will be traded when the market opens at 09:15 AM. This 3-minute window of time is like a connection section between the pre-opening session and the normal trading hours. It behaves like a buffer to ease the transition into the regular trading session. Again, during these 3 minutes as well, you cannot place, modify, or cancel any orders. This is known as the continuous trading session. It runs from 09:15 AM to 03:30 PM. You are able to buy and sell stock freely during this session, and you are able to place buy or sell orders for stock as well as modify or cancel those buy or sell orders without any restrictions. An order-matching mechanism is adopted within the window. Every sell order is thus against a buy order at the same stock price, and every buy order is against the buy order at the same stock price. This session begins when the regular trading session comes to a close at 03:30 PM. The post-closing session, which runs up to 04:00 PM, consists of two sections. In these 10 minutes, the closing prices of stocks are calculated by taking the weighted average of the stock prices traded between 03:00 PM and 03:30 PM. The closing prices ofindiceslike Sensex and Nifty are calculated by considering the weighted average prices of all the securities that are listed in that index. In this 20-minute section, you can still place buy and sell orders. But the orders are confirmed only if there are sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers in the market. Here’s how you can invest in the stock market step by step: Pick a broker or trading app. Complete your KYC and registration. Add money to your account using bank transfer or other payment options. Check company details, market trends, and reports. Beginners can start with blue-chip stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs. Buy stocks through your broker or app. Begin small and increase slowly. Invest in different sectors to reduce risk. Track the market to keep your stocks aligned with your goals. Stock market timings define the hours during which trading activities take place. Markets operate in sessions. These include pre-market, regular trading, and post-market periods. Let’s analyse theequity market time in Indiain detail: Stock market closing times in India are divided into two key trading sessions: morning and afternoon. These sessions define when investors can engage in trading before the market shuts for the day. – Opening Time: The India stock market start time is 9:15 AM IST. – Closing Time: 12:30 PM IST. – The market sees high activity as global trends influence early trades. – Opening Time: 12:30 PM IST. – Closing Time: The Market closes at 3:30 PM IST, marking the end of share market trading timings in India. – Investors make final trades before the closing bell. Additionally, different exchanges may have variations in the India stock market trading time, especially for post-market and after-hours trading Aftermarket orders give investors a chance to trade even after the stock market closes. This is useful when big news or announcements come after hours. In India, brokerages accept these orders between 4 PM and 9 AM for the next day’s market open. This way, investors can react to overnight developments, secure better prices, or adjust their portfolios. It allows more flexibility and helps them prepare strategically for the next trading session. On most public and national holidays, the Indian stock market stays closed. But there is a special one-hour session called Muhurat trading on Diwali. This tradition exists because Diwali is considered an auspicious day for wealth and prosperity. The exact timing of this session changes each year and is announced in advance. Many investors participate during this hour, often using share trading apps, to mark the beginning of their financial year with positive investments. Being aware of share market timings in India is vital to earn profits, especially if you pursueintraday trading. All you need is anonline Demat accountandtrading accountto get started on your journey of trading or investing in the share market.

    "title": "Is the Indian stock market closed today for Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi?",
    "body": "Stock market holiday:As Eid-e-Milad, which marks the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad, is being celebrated today, September 5, investors may get confused whether the Indian stock market will be open or closed for trading. According to thestock market holiday calendarshared by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE, trading activities on the BSE and NSE will remain open today, which means today is not a stock market holiday. The Indian stock market will be open for trading during for regular trading on Friday. As per the calendar,in the month of September, there are no additional holidaysapart from the weekends. Considering that, the Indian stock market will be closed for trading on eight days in September. The next stock market holiday will now fall in the month of October. According to the stock market holiday calendar, NSE and BSE will remain closed for trading for five days during the week over the next three months. In October, the stock market will be closed for trading on three days. The first holiday in October will fall on October 2 for Dussehra and Gandhi Jayanti. Thereafter, BSE and NSE will be closed for trading on October 21 and October 22 for Diwali Laxmi Pujan and Balipratipada. Meanwhile, in November and December, there is one market holiday each for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and Christmas, respectively. Here's a look at stock market holidays in the rest of 2025: The Indian benchmark indices, after a strong rally in early trade,ended on a flat note on Thursday, as losses in Reliance Industries and IT stocks weighed. While the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) Council approved a shift to a two-rate structure from the existing four and cut levies on everyday items, boosting auto and FMCG stocks, concerns around US tariffs lingered. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 0.08% higher at 24,734, and the BSE Sensex gained 0.19% to 80,718.01. In early trade, both indices had jumped 1.1%. \"In-line outcome of GST rationalisation and ongoing tariff threats from the US exerted a negative impact on the market today. Given that the US is India's largest export destination, accounting for 2.2% of the GDP, the repercussions are inevitable. Companies are exploring ways to maintain exports to their existing clients through strategies like cross-country billing and setting up manufacturing units abroad. However, exports are expected to slow down and hinder new growth opportunities,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. On the brighter side, the GST rate cut is expected to significantly boost domestic consumption demand, countering the adverse effects of diminished export competitiveness, he added.

    "body": "Both NSE and BSE will remain open on September 8, with trading beginning as usual at 9:15 AM, unaffected by the festive celebrations. New Delhi:India’s festive season kicked off in September with Eid-e-Milad and Onam being celebrated across different parts of the country. Despite the festivities, stock market operations have continued without disruption. However, a bit of confusion did arise among traders and investors over whether the markets would remain open on September 8, after the RBI shifted the earlier-declared money market holiday from September 5 to September 8. Both NSE and BSE will remain open on September 8, with trading beginning as usual at 9:15 AM, unaffected by the festive celebrations. Add Zee News as a Preferred Source Yes, but only the money market. The Maharashtra government has shifted the money market holiday from September 5 to September 8, which was earlier aligned with Eid-e-Milad. This change was made to keep settlement cycles smooth on September 5. However, equity markets will remain unaffected. Trading will continue as usual on September 8 and on all other weekdays for the rest of September 2025. (Also Read: Notification On Handling Goods Stocked Under Higher GST Slabs Soon) Because of the Eid-e-Milad settlement holiday on September 8, mutual fund transactions will see slight changes in processing. Any purchase or redemption requests made after the cut-off time on September 5 in liquid or debt schemes will now be processed on September 9. Transactions like allotments and redemptions set for September 8 will be settled a day later, on September 9. The only exception is equity schemes, which will be processed as usual on September 8. Redemption fund payouts, however, will not take place on September 5 or September 8.

    "title": "Stock Market Holiday: Are BSE, NSE open or closed today for Eid-e-Milad 2025?",
    "body": "ETMarkets.com Indian stock exchanges will operate as usual today, September 5, despite the observance of Milad-Un-Nabi. Trading follows a fixed holiday calendar, and Milad-Un-Nabi is not listed as a full-day market holiday. The commodity segment will also remain open, with no break in either the morning or afternoon sessions. Also known as Eid-e-Milad, the day marks the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. It is observed in the third month of the Islamic calendar, Rabi-ul-Awwal. However, today will be a settlement holiday , meaning that settlement and transactions carried out on Thursday will be shifted to Monday. What is a settlement holiday? Unlike a trading holiday, when the stock exchanges NSE and BSE are shut and investors cannot buy or sell shares, on a settlement holiday the exchanges remain open for trading, but clearing and settlement of trades do not take place because banks, depositories such as NSDL and CDSL , or the RBI are closed. In simpler terms, trades get executed, but the pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities are deferred to the next working day. Stock market holidays 2025: Full list Equity markets have a total of 15 trading holidays in 2025, of which 10 have already passed. The remaining 5 are for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti and Dussehra on October 02, Diwali or Laxmi Pujan on October 21, Diwali Balipratipada on October 22, Prakash Gurpurab on November 05, and Christmas on December 25. It should be noted that a special Muhurat Trading session will be conducted on October 21, which marks the beginning of the Hindu Samvat year. The timings of Muhurat Trading have not yet been announced and will be notified in due course. Stock market outlook Indian markets received a big boost from the government following the simplification of the GST regime. Various goods and services will now be taxed under two key rates—5% and 18%—with certain sin and luxury goods placed under a special 40% slab. However, the markets did not reflect much enthusiasm on Thursday as most of the news was already priced in. Benchmark indices experienced a choppy trading session, ending with marginal gains. The broader markets underperformed the benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining by 0.6% each, reflecting a risk-off sentiment among investors toward non-index constituents. Overall, analysts expect Nifty to consolidate in the range of 24,400-25,000 amid stock-specific actions. \"Immediate support is placed at 24,400-24,337 levels, being the confluence of recent lows and the key retracement area. A breach below this range will signal an acceleration of the decline toward the key support area of 24,000-23,800 levels in the coming week,\" Bajaj Broking said in a note.

The symbolic trading session will be held between 1:45 pm and 2:45 pm, the stock exchanges said in separate circulars. Last year, the special Muhurat trading session was held from 6 pm to 7 pm. The new session also marks the beginning of a new Samvat (Vikram Samvat 2082) -- the Hindu calendar year that starts on Diwali -- and it is believed that trading during the 'Muhurat' or auspicious hour brings prosperity and financial growth for the stakeholders. The market will remain closed for regular trading on Diwali, but a special trading window will be open for one hour. The exchange announced that the pre-opening session will take place from 1:30 pm to 1.45 pm. Market analysts noted that Diwali is considered an auspicious occasion to begin new ventures, and many investors believe participating in the Muhurat trading session brings prosperity throughout the year. However, with the trading window limited to just an hour, the markets often witness heightened volatility. Analysts added that the significance of the session lies more in its symbolic value than in immediate profitability. Trading would take place across various segments like equity, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, equity futures & options, and securities lending & borrowing (SLB) in the same time slot, according to separate circulars issued by the bourses.

(LTF), one of the leading Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in the country, has announced attractive loan offers for its Two- wheeler Finance customers. The Company has introduced three new offerings, namely, No Cost EMI, Prompt Payment Rebate, and the EMI Lite Festive (buy in 2025, pay in 2026) scheme aiming to provide a fillip to the festive buying spirit. Under the No Cost EMI scheme, customers can finance their purchase without incurring interest charges on the loan amount; the only associated fee is a nominal documentation charge. The Prompt Payment Rebate scheme is available to customers who select a minimum repayment tenure of 36 months, offering a waiver of the final EMI upon successfully repaying the EMIs for 35 months through central clearance. Finally, the EMI Lite Festive scheme allows customers to pay only the interest portion of their EMI for the first two months of the loan term, with no principal amount included in their monthly payment during this initial period, thus making it a buy in 2025 and pay in 2026, making festivals more affordable. Speaking about the new launches, Mr. Sudipta Roy, Managing Director and CEO at LTF, said, “With an advanced version of ‘Project Cyclops’ now live in our Two-wheeler Finance business and the revised GST slabs for bikes and scooters effective this month, we believe this is an opportune time to launch attractive schemes for our customers. Our Two-wheeler Finance business is one of the top three fulcrum products. As one of the leading financiers in this segment, having a prime-dominant portfolio and a best-in-class zero DPD (Days Past Due) record vis-à-vis the industry, we foresee that these offers will drive a substantial surge in demand and strengthen our leadership position.” Mr. Jinesh Shah, Chief Executive – Urban Secured Assets & Third-Party Products at LTF, said, “With over 75 lakh customers served in urban India, we have a profound understanding of the market’s needs. This allowed us to craft a spectacular array of enticing two-wheeler loan offerings that truly benefit our potential customers. Supported by our well- diversified footprint and a network of over 10,000 sourcing points, we are confident that customers will seize this exceptional opportunity to own a two-wheeler and fulfill their aspirations with us as their preferred financier. We anticipate a surge in demand for Two-wheelers given the strong support of lower GST by the government and we are ready for the increased customer inflow at our partner dealer outlets to help fulfill their dreams.” The festive schemes will be valid for customers availing loans until November 30, 2025. In addition, LTF has been offering the best interest rates to deserving customers and offers customers a quick turnaround time of 5 minutes to decide on a loan, aided by a best-in-class digital process wherein no documents are required physically from customers. The Company has also launched its latest TV commercial (TVC), ‘Just Zoom Two-wheeler Loans’, with the tagline ‘Bumrah Ki Speed Par,’ featuring its brand ambassador, Jasprit Bumrah.

The offer was disclosed by Thyssenkrupp AG’s CEO, Miguel López, during a meeting with the company’s Supervisory Board. This marks a potential strategic shift for the European steel sector, as Jindal aims to gain a stronger foothold in the continent. Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe specializes in high-grade flat steel products, including carbon steel, electrical steel, and packaging steel. It operates major facilities in Germany (e.g., Duisburg) and is a key player in green steel initiatives, with products like bluemint®️ (low-CO2 steel). However, the unit has faced ongoing challenges, including high energy costs, global competition, and profitability issues, prompting Thyssenkrupp to seek partners or buyers. Jindal Steel’s Motivation as an Indian steel giant with access to raw materials and expertise in sustainable (“green”) steel production, Jindal sees this acquisition as a way to expand into Europe. It could leverage Thyssenkrupp’s established market presence and technology for low-carbon steel, aligning with global decarbonization trends.

Tuesday’s close at 25,239 confirms a fresh swing high (H), potentially invalidating the earlier lower-high pattern. This move is supported by a higher low (HL) at 24,404 from the August 29 candle, reinforcing the case for sustained momentum. If the index holds above these levels, the previous high at 25,669 now stands as a key resistance. A breakout could pave the way for a fresh higher high (HH) near 25,800. On the downside, 25,150 has flipped into short-term support, while the psychological 25,000 remains a critical cushion for investors. Bank Nifty Outlook Bank Nifty has delivered a strong technical signal, breaking out above the descending broadening wedge’s resistance slope at 54,900—indicating the downtrend from July to September may have ended. After carving out a lower low at 53,561, the index is now trending higher toward the crucial resistance at 56,156, the last lower high. A breakout above this level could mark a decisive long-term trend reversal and boost investor confidence in the banking space. Until then, the possibility of consolidation remains. Key supports are placed at 54,905 (August 8 low) and 54,777 (yesterday’s floor), offering a base for stability. Fundamental Outlook US markets closed on a cautious note yesterday, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision, with uneven employment data fueling uncertainty amid ongoing trade discussions. European equities ended the day lower, shaken by ambiguity surrounding US policy directions and escalating geopolitical concerns that weighed on sentiment. Asian markets opened with a generally subdued performance today, reflecting Wall Street’s hesitance and concerns over potential tariff hikes, though select regions showed resilience. Indian markets are expected to open slightly softer but remain supported by robust domestic sectors like technology and banking, with optimism tied to the Fed’s anticipated actions potentially sparking a recovery. September 17, 2025 08:45 Stock market live today: Morning Market Views by Hariprasad K, Founder - Livelong Wealth Fundamental Views Gift Nifty is hovering around 25,300, hinting at a positive to flat start. However, global cues remain cautious as Wall Street closed lower ahead of the US Fed’s policy announcement. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver its first rate cut of 2025, but investors are closely watching for guidance on further easing. Asian markets opened lower, mirroring the global wait-and-watch sentiment. Volatility remains muted with India VIX at 10.27, suggesting low fear in the market. Dreamfolks Services will be in focus after announcing the discontinuation of airport lounge services in India, a move expected to have a material business impact Technical Views Nifty 50 closed at 25,239, continuing to display strong short-term bullish momentum as the index trades above both its 9-day and 15-day EMAs. A bullish crossover, with EMA 9 crossing above EMA 15 which further strengthens the upside view. Momentum Indicators are also confirming this uptrend. RSI stands at 63.84, firmly in the bullish zone but still shy of the overbought threshold (70+), indicating room for further upside. MACD remains positive with the line above its signal line and a green histogram, reflecting strong buying momentum. Price has also broken above a key descending trendline, confirming a bullish breakout. September 17, 2025 08:45 Stock market live today: Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities on today’s market outlook Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Nifty appears bullish ahead of the widely expected 25-basis point Fed rate cut on 17 September, with the street already positioning for the move. The benchmark index looks set to extend its constructive rally into Diwali and the New Year, supported by a series of Fed cuts. Technically, strength will be confirmed only above 25,670 (high of 30 June), with key support at the 21-DMA of 24,853. The bias remains risk-on as long as Nifty holds above 24,853. Bullish charts include HBL Engineering, JSW Energy, and Prestige Estate. Top pick: HBL Engineering (CMP 909), buy at 890–900, stop 833, targets 923/953 and 1,150. September 17, 2025 08:44 Stock recommendations: Nomura’s coverage on Prestige Estates Projects with a ‘Buy’ and target price of Rs 1,900 Doing all things right: Transforming into a pan-India player, while building a solid annuity-plus-hotel portfolio Action: Initiate coverage at Buy with a target price of INR1,900, implying 17% upside. We initiate coverage on Prestige Estates Projects with Buy rating, as: 1) we believe the company’s pan-India growth strategy is superior to peers, and a strong scale-up is likely, particularly in Mumbai and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), driven by both mid-income township and luxury projects; 2) superior execution should help scale PEPL’s annuity and hotel EBITDA 4-5x over the next 4-5 years; and 3) cheaper valuations given the stock currently trades at a ~40% premium to NAV, lower than Godrej Properties (Reduce; pan-India player with similar pre-sales) at 108%. Moreover, we believe PEPL will beat FY26E pre-sales guidance of ~INR260bn by +10%, with upside risk. Our TP of INR1,900 is based on SOTP (Fig. 52). Downside risks: a slowdown in the Bangalore real estate ( RE) market or weaker-than-expected leasing of annuity assets.
