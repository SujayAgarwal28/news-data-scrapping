The Nifty plunged to a three-month low. 09:15 (IST) 04 Oct 2018 Dollar lifted by yield surge, Asia stocks slugged The dollar notched an 11-month top on the yen on Thursday as stunningly strong U.S. economic data drove Treasury yields to their highest since mid-2011, while Asian stocks were pressured as borrowing costs rose at home, said a Reuters report. Higher U.S. yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies. Bond prices fell across Asia and long-term Japanese yields reached ground not visited since early 2016, a market tightening not warranted by domestic economic conditions. 09:14 (IST) 04 Oct 2018 Market Pre-open: Sensex down 155 points, Nifty below 10,800; rupee at fresh record low of 73.76/$ Sensex live: The BSE Sensex plunged 155.10 points or 0.43% to 35,820.53 points in the pre-open trade session on Thursday.

    "title": "India’s stock market skyrockets the most in 10 years after surprise tax cut",
    "body": "Indian stocks surged overnight Friday after the country’s government announced a big cut to India’s corporate tax rate. The India S&P BSE Sensex index jumped 5.3% to notch its biggest one-day gain since May 5, 2009. That day, the index soared 17.3%. The U.S.-listed iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA) gained about 5.3%, its best day since Sept. 4, 2013, when it popped 5.5%. Corporations in India will now be taxed at aneffective rate of 25.17%, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Friday. That’s down from an effective tax rate of 30%. The lower corporate tax rate comes as the Indian government tries to reignite India’s economy. India’s GDP growth rate has fallen for six straight quarters through the first half of 2019. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, the Indian economy was growing at an 8.1% rate. That growth rate has since fallen to 5% through the second quarter of this year. “It was becoming evident that counter-cyclical policy responses may need to become more aggressive, but expectations were centered on monetary policy to do the heavy lifting,” Kaushik Das, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. “Very few expected any fiscal stimulus.” “This is a big bang reform, for which corporate India has been waiting a long time and we expect it will raise the animal spirits in the economy,” Das said. Indian stocks have lagged the broader emerging markets this year. The Sensex is up 5.4% in 2019, while the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) has gained about 7% in that time. “The tax cuts will undoubtedly boost sentiment, and that is likely to have a growth-enhancing impact,” Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note. “However, how much investment firms will undertake in response to the tax cut remains to be seen, especially given weak demand conditions.” — CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

    "body": "July 2019 turns out to be the worst in 17 years for Nifty and Sensex August 1, 2019 Up next Published on 01 August 2019 Author Vineeth N C Tags BSE , FPI , NSE Nifty , Sensex Share article The post has been shared by 0 people. Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Pinterest 0 Mail 0 The Indian stock markets recorded their worst July performance in 17 years as Sensex and Nifty went down by 4.86% and 5.69% respectively. This slump in the benchmark indices reminds us of the depreciation that happened in July 2002, when Sensex fell by 7.92%. The Indian equity market was under immense pressure in July as the Union Budget 2019-20 did not address any of the investors’ concerns, which resulted in the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pressing the selling button. Also, the downward movements that Sensex and Nifty recorded were the sharpest monthly decline since October 2018. Inopportune budget amendments, economic slowdown, liquidity crunch, and reduced consumption are the primary reasons for the fall. Also Read: Government and policymakers left with concerns as FPIs continue selling The Indian capital market attracted FPIs when the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty exceeded their record levels of 40,000 and 12,000 points respectively in May. This is when the post-poll survey predicted the return of the BJP-led government. The FPIs infused a whopping Rs 10,384.54 crore in June, they were citing favourable amendments but were let down by Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister of India, in her maiden Budget presented on 5 July 2019. The FPIs have gone into a rigorous selling mood since the second week of July, they have pulled nearly Rs 3,800 crore, which is the highest among the emerging markets in July. Emerging markets such as Thailand and South Korea have received a steady FPI inflow in July 2019. The downfall of the Indian markets at the time when the rupee is up by 0.34% and downward movement in the crude prices is a worrisome factor for the Indian Government and policymakers. The most significant reason for the FPIs to pull out of the Indian capital market is the increase in surcharge on FPIs registered as association and trusts. The Union Budget 2019-20 hiked the tax outgo of the super-rich which has made them consider the newly elected government look more aligned towards the left.

Metals and Bank stocks showed signs of short covering, which is positive for the market as these stocks have very high beta and can change the momentum of the market. Today, number of FMCG stocks closed lower against the rise in metals and Banks that could be big positive for the market as it implies that investors are ready to shift from defensive sector to high risk sectors or investors are ready to handle risk in the market. Technically, below the level of 10,850 we were expecting 10,740 and 10,630, however, Nifty got arrested at 10,740 and recovered back to day’s highest level, which was at 10,840.

    "title": "What’s driving the investor bet on Sensex stocks",
    "body": "Minttakes a look at what is driving the stock market. 1)Are the current levels of the stock market justified? Till now, in fiscal 2019-20, the price-to-earnings (P-E) ratio of the 30 shares that constitute the BSE Sensex, India’s most popular stock market index, has been at 28.17. The P-E ratio is the market price of a share divided by its earnings per share. When investors buy a share at a certain price, they are basically paying for the future earnings of that company. So far this fiscal, investors have paid₹28.17 on an average for every rupee of earning for Sensex shares. This is the highest average P-E ratio in more than 20 years. Thus, it’s important to understand what exactly the stock market is paying for. 2)Why are investors paying such a high price for shares? A high P-E ratio means that while share prices are going up, earnings of firms are not. People investing in the stock market hope that as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a bigger majority this time, his government will initiate another round of reforms on labour, land and capital. These reforms will improve ease of doing business. This will help companies expand businesses and spur the launch of several new businesses, thus creating jobs. The creation of more jobs will help people earn more, leading to greater spending, which will benefit businesses and improve their earnings. 3)Have P-E ratios ever been so high in the past? P-E ratios were high in mid-2000, when the dotcom bubble was on, and in December 2007 and early January 2008, when the market was rallying, before the financial crisis set in. 4)What are the other reasons for such a strong market? In the last decade, the central banks of Western countries, led by the Federal Reserve of the US, have followed an easy-money policy. This allowed foreign investors to borrow money at low interest rates in the West, buy shares all over the world and drive up share prices in the process. In the last few months, the Federal Reserve has more or less signalled that this easy money policy is likely to continue. This has given further hope to stock market investors in India. 5)What about the consumption slowdown? Investors expect the new government to tackle the consumption slowdown by raising its spending. This is a short-term hope that has driven up the stock market, despite lack of earnings growth of firms. The government needs to avoid the mistakes made in 2008-09, when it increased spending and pushed public sector banks to run an easy credit policy. This later led to high inflation and massive bad loans of those banks. Vivek Kaul is an economist and the author of the Easy Money trilogy.

    "body": "From United States to Japan , over 180 geographies have reported a confirmed case of coronavirus and almost everyone on this planet is adversely affected by this virus. An event of this scale would bring along many catastrophic consequences- social and economic. Many pundits have already declared COVID-19 as the “Black Swan” of 2020 with global economies starring at one of their worst recessions ever. There is something strange happening in the stock markets across the globe, especially India. To say the least, it seems like the markets are either not paying adequate seriousness to the pandemic or anticipating the discovery of a vaccine more optimistically when compared to the rest of the world. The bounce back to pre-COVID levels has left many investors in ambiguity. This piece is not about predicting what will happen to the markets going forward rather it talks about what could be a possible explanation to the path markets followed since the announcement of lockdown in India. Before we get into the numbers, almost all of us would agree that the Indian economy has never experienced such a massive shock- to both demand and supply in its recent past. The world of 2020 is in uncharted waters. While enough has been written about the increase volatility in the markets, below is some analysis on the daily movement of BSE Sensex for past 10 years. The analysis is based on the number of days the index gained or lost 1 per cent or more. This clearly shows how 2020 stands as an outlier when compared to 2011-2019, with approximately six months to go from here. 2020 stands tall among all these years with roughly having a 1 per cent or more gain/loss every second trading day. Take a look at this analysis from historical data. The above line represents the ratio of days the index gained 1 per cent or more to days when it lost 1 per cent or more. At 1.32, it is almost equal to the highest value which was 1.33 back in 2017. The line below depicts the index return for that year. There is a sharp divergence in 2020 as shown by the data. With a gain to loss ratio of 1.33, 2017 closed with a gain of 28 per cent but 2020, with a ratio of 1.32 has a return of -9 per cent so far till July 22nd, 2020. This means, the change in index in 2020 is skewed towards bigger negative values. The next graph makes this case stronger. Remember we have over five months to close this year. The frequency of the daily market moves is also exceptional. Of the 13 times when Sensex lost 2.5 per cent or more in 2020, seven came in the month of March. While it is relevant to draw comparison to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 with COVID-19 for medical reasons, no such event exists to draw parallel of COVID-19 and its impact on Indian financial markets. Though the mortality rate of COVID-19 is less when compared with Spanish flu, the implications for economy are far more severe. Back in those times, supply chains were not interlinked as they are today. One of the possible explanations of the markets reacting so sharply to COVID-19 in March is the supply chain integration across the globe. Recent developments have led to heavy reliance on geographically expansive supply chains and the ubiquity of just-in-time inventory systems. Both are highly vulnerable to sudden supply disruptions. While disruptions to international supply chains surely have contributed to a contraction in economic activity, but that might not be complete answer. If this was the case, the markets should have reacted when China went into a lockdown or when pandemic was at its peak in Europe. Another possible explanation could be the role and contribution of services in our GDP. Long distance travel has become common supporting tourism and hospitality sectors and facilitating commercial activity in education, entertainment , and other sectors. While we use technology in every sphere of life, the structure of economy has also evolved where interactions take place in proximity. An abrupt and compulsory lock down imposed on 1.3 bn Indians brought about uncertainty of future. Once people adjusted with the new normal of staying indoors, the odds of Sensex falling by 2.5% or more became less. I recognize that these conclusions have a broad bush character and there is much room for further investigations into the relative importance of voluntary social distancing efforts and government restrictions, as well as studies that seek to quantify the role of restrictions. There is also much room for research into the stock market reactions to fiscal and monetary policy actions during the 2020 pandemic.",

    "body": "Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in Dalal Street (Express photo by Nirmal Harindran) Share/Stock Highlights: The frontline equity indices on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended around 1 per cent lower on Monday tracking weakness in the global market.

(with inputs from agencies) Live Blog Stocks, BSE Sensex, NSE Nifty, Crude oil prices, gold, silver prices, commodity market and money markets LIVE updates: 16:12 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 MARKET QUOTE | Milind Muchhala, Executive Director, Julius Baer on Monday's market performance \"The Indian markets finally seem to be taking a small pause, largely driven by nervousness in the global markets. Two key factors playing on the minds of global investors include the upcoming Fed meeting and the uncertainty building up in the Chinese real estate market due to stress on one of the major property players in the country. While the markets are keenly awaiting clarity on Fed’s taper plans in terms of timelines and quantum, we believe it may give an advance notice on tapering in this week’s meeting, followed by a formal announcement at the following meeting in November. The pace of tapering is expected to be gradual, and the Fed is expected to continue to remain accommodative in its monetary policy stance, which should be supportive for equities. Regarding the Chinese property major, it may be a bit too early to conclude on any possible contagion effects on global markets. Regarding the Indian markets, a few underperforming stocks/sections of the market, including the PSU pack, have started catching up to some extent, providing support to the headline indices. The breadth of the market, however, seems to be worsening a bit, which is a sign of caution. A small correction would be welcome at this juncture, and help the markets to become healthier, although the bulls are still not willing to give up reins. On the positive side, there is no fear factor currently, and investors seem to be on the lookout for corrections to add positions. With an improving pace and scale of vaccination, the economic environment is also expected to remain supported.\" 16:04 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 MARKET QUOTE | Vinod Nair, Head Of Research, Geojit Financial Services on Monday's market performance \"Following high volatility and weak global sentiments, the domestic market ended in a bear grip with Metal and PSU Banks leading the downward rally. Global markets traded negatively as investors were cautious ahead of multiple central bank policy meetings scheduled this week. However, due to weak US job data and inflation increasing at a slower pace, Fed is not expected to hint on taper plans in the upcoming meeting.\" 15:44 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 Equity markets at close The S&P BSE Sensex ended at 58,490.93, down 524.96 points or 0.89 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 17,396.90, down 188.25 points or 1.07 per cent. 15:17 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 Gold starts week on back foot as Fed meet looms, dollar gains Gold prices were pressured on Monday, hurt by a stronger dollar and concerns the US Federal Reserve might hint at when it intends to begin tapering its asset purchases in its upcoming meeting. Spot gold was little changed at $1,755.84 per ounce by 0847 GMT, having earlier touched its lowest level since Aug. 12 at $1,741.86. US gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,755.00. The Federal Reserve's keenly awaited policy meeting begins on Tuesday. (Reuters) 15:15 (IST) 20 Sep 2021 Copper futures fall on weak demand Copper futures on Monday slipped 1.71 per cent to Rs 708.85 per kg, as participants cut their positions amid muted demand in the domestic market. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for the September delivery eased by Rs 12.30, or 1.71 per cent, to Rs 708.85 per kg in a business turnover of 3,603 lots. Analysts said trimming of positions by speculators due to muted demand in the spot market mainly led to the fall in copper prices here.

Bajaj Finance was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying over 4 per cent, followed by SBI, Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and M&M. On the other hand, NTPC, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, Tata Steel and L&T were among the laggards. Benchmark indices have again pared all gains and are currently trading in negative territory. At around 2:10 pm, BSE Sensex was down by 26 points while Nifty fell below 11,450 points. Meanwhile, broader markets have yet again outperformed benchmark indices. The rupee on Tuesday closed flat at 74.32 per US dollar. Yash Gupta,Equity Research Associate, Angel Broking:Lupin Ltd got approval from the U.S. FDA for Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol, 90 mcg (base)/actuation, a generic version of ProAir® HFA. Lupin’s generic Albuterol Sulphate MDI will be manufactured at its Indore facility in India. ProAir® HFA are indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of asthmatic symptoms. Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol market had U.S. sales of approximately US$2.9 billion, of which the ProAir® HFA market accounted for US$1.3 billion (IQVIA MAT June 2020).This is one of the very significant approval for Lupin, which has been in the pipeline for some time and will be taken positively by the markets. Sensex and Nitty are off day's high and are currently trading flat. At 12:00 pm, Sensex was trading higher by 90.88 points at 38,889.96 while Nifty fell below the 11,500-mark. Jaikishan Parmar, Sr. Equity Research Analyst, Angel Broking:LIC reported Mixed set of numbers for Q1FY21, AUM increase 6% YoY and steady QoQ, PAT jumped by 34% to Rs.817.48cr. On moratorium front, Individual Home Loans under moratorium accounted for 16% an Approximately 25% of the Company’s total loans under management are in moratorium as of June 30, 2020. NII increase 3% YoY ted below AUM growth primarily owing to compression in NIM. Opex increase by 36%, however, lower provision cost has helped LIC housing to report PAT jump of 34% YoY. Considering the current situation provision taken in Q4FY20 and Q1FY20 is much lower than expected. Currently LIC housing trades at 0.75x of TTM Networth which is lower compare to the historical average. Considering lower valuation and not much negative in result stock could see positive movement for midterm. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, AngelBroking:Markets across the globe were quite cheerful yesterday morning and hence, we too started off higher above the11400mark. As the day progressed, the positive momentum reinforced after a brief pause; courtesy to smart surge in banking conglomerates. Eventually, the benchmark continued it’s march towards11500, marking highest level since March fiasco. Since last a week or so, we are sounding a bit cautious on the market. But it seems that market is in no mood to give any sort of correction. Actually, on the domestic front, there is no negative news flow which is considered as positive and most importantly, major global markets are clearly unstoppable, which is driving our markets higher. Although we have actively participated in the recent midcap rally, we still continue to be a watchful and would advise taking some money off the table. Because when markets are giving such gravity defying moves, nobody knows when and what’s going to trigger a correction. And whenever it happens, it just comes as a surprise. With a broader view, we remain extremely sanguine but do not want to become complacent here and hence would advise against aggressive longs in the market. As far as levels are concerned,11450-11500is an extended zone for us but with the flow, if it extends further, then we continue to advise booking profits in case if Nifty heads towards11550-11625. The dollar slipped on Tuesday and Asia’s trade-exposed currencies rose after the United States and China both hailed a phone call between their top trade officials as a success --Reuters Sensex and Nifty on Tuesday opened higher for a second consecutive day.

Several analysts expect markets to open on a positive note on Tuesday after US stocks surged to touch record highs amid hopes of faster vaccine availability to treat coronavirus. European stocks also closed higher and Asian markets have begun the day on a strong note. All of the indicators hint at a strong opening for India markets. Top United States and Chinese officials have showed optimism on resolving issues over the Phase 1 trade deal reached in January and both sides are committed to the success of the agreement, according to the US Trade Representative's Office. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Tresury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke to Chinese Vice Premier Liu He over telephone to discuss the trade deal. This is another reason which boosted global markets. Asian stock markets opened significantly higher on Tuesday following a record Wall Street rally driven by vaccine hopes. The US dollar also found support ahead of the key central bank speech. Strong global cues indicate a solid gap-up opening for domestic markets in India. Domestic benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty, are expected to open higher on Tuesday after a strong rally in global stocks. SGX Nifty trends also indicate that markets in India will open higher for the second consecutive day.

The global positive sentiment was driven by additional stimulus measures from ECB. Investors are banking on a global economic recovery, fuelled by central bank policy measures to support the respective economies. Investors need to be a bit cautious since valuations are running high and the expected recovery is not yet visible in the numbers,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said in a statement after the market hours.

    "body": "Gone are the times when school students were taught stories with the moral of “slow and steady wins the race”. However, in the age of 4 th Industrial Revolution, this moral has adapted itself and now rewards creativity and speed to “win a race.” This is especially true about the global financial sector- more so for the stock indices around the world. One of the most important indicators of any economy is the flagship stock market index of that country, for instance, Sensex in India and NASDAQ for the Unites States. Each day we come across these indices gaining or losing points and financial experts coming up with their targets for such indices. While they serve as a fair proxy to understand the state of an economy, which companies constitute these indexes and how much share does each company’s revenue have in these stock market indices, is also an interesting aspect to be understood. The BSE Sensex or the S&P BSE Sensex is a list of 30 companies that form a part of the BSE Index (Sensex). These companies are taken from diverse sectors and that too with a high market capitalisation. The base value of the S&P BSE Sensex is taken as 100 on 1 April 1979 and its base year as 1978-79, which is why we have taken companies that were there in 1978. The first iteration of the Sensex was dominated by the Tata Group. Over the years, there has been a lot of churn in the Sensex. In its early days, Sensex was dominated by manufacturing companies, there were as many as six Tata companies in the index — ACC, Tata Power, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Voltas and Indian Hotels. The extended Birla group had another five — Century Textiles, Grasim, Indian Rayon, Hindalco and Hindustan Motors. The Sensex now is less dominated by a few groups although, there are still three Tata companies in the list (TCS, Tata Steel and Titan). There was hardly any representation of banks in the Sensex until the early 1990s but today about 45% of the index is composed by financial sector companies . The latest addition to this list is Shree cements replacing Yes bank. The changing composition of the Sensex tells us two big stories — of the rise of a new generation of Indian firms as well as a broad shift from manufacturing towards services. A similar analysis of United States’ top firms reveals a shift from manufacturing to technology companies. A 100 years ago, US Steel was the world’s largest company by market capital, a title held by Apple Inc. today while other giants like Microsoft and Alphabet not very far either. The top-most five of the Top 10 companies in the Unites States by market capitalization today are technology companies, validating innovation as the “new moral”. An integral component of these firms’ success is their focus to emerging ventures called “startups” through their dedicated accelerator programs. While it is hard to imagine what this list would look like in the year, say, 2070, certainly it would not only be starkly different from what it is today but also would reflect the nature and relevance of finance in the coming years. Due to the emergence of disruptive business models, data has come to be a huge asset today- something that would have seemed impossible a few decades ago. The key to sustain in the business world today is to be creative and fast- a new moral to win the race . Update: On December 3, 2021, Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Infinity Forum on fintech, which among other things will discuss and come up with actionable insights into how technology can be leveraged by the fintech industry for inclusive growth.",

The rally in the domestic market was also led by Banking and Finance stocks on improved business outlook post Q2 results, end to moratorium and bounce back of economic activities. Broader market has shown under performance compared to headline peers as investors feel safer chasing heavyweights during high market levels. We expect more stimulus measures are required to boost the economy and announcements regarding the same from the government is expected in the near future that can further accelerate our domestic market,”Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Servicessaid in a post-market statement. World stocks hit a record high on Monday and the dollar stayed weak as expectations of better global trade ties and more monetary stimulus under US President-electJoe Bidensupported risk appetite. Markets started to trade on the prospect of a Biden presidency and a Republican-controlled US Senate last week, but the Democratic candidate’s projected victory on Saturday gave more fuel to the move. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.5 per cent to a record high in early European hours. On Friday, it posted its biggest one-week gain in nearly seven months. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 jumped more than 1.4 per cent on Monday. Nasdaq futures rallied more than 2 per cent to just under a record high, signalling a positive start for US markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan jumped 1.3 per cent after hitting its highest since January 2018.

    "body": "The Bank Nifty index witnessed volatility throughout the day and ended negatively. After a gap-down opening, the index managed to hold the support of 38,800-38,500 on the downside, indicating the bias remains on the positive side. The immediate hurdle on the upside is placed at 39,500 and once taken out will see a sharp move on the upside towards 41,000 levels. Nifty remained sideways during the day before ending 1% lower. After starting to gap down on the back of a weak global cue, the Nifty failed to recover fully and traded within a range for the day. The momentum indicator is in a bearish crossover indicating a bearishness. On the lower end, 17400 may continue to act as crucial support, below which the index may become weak again. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 17700. Domestic indices moved in line with peers while prospects of higher rate hikes, elevated inflation and a slowing economy put pressure on stock markets around the world. Although India’s Q1 GDP was reported below the RBI’s estimate of 16.2%, the strong growth seen in manufacturing activity during Q2 so far indicates a strong recovery in the domestic market. Additionally, ongoing support from FIIs will obscure the weakness, helping domestic indices to stay resilient. Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "body": "Indian share indices ended 1.2% higher on Wednesday as soft crude oil prices supported sentiment. FMCG, banks & financials and auto stocks led the rally. Stocks dipped in Asia today as fears of an economic downturn lingered over financial markets, leaving the dollar hovering at the highest level in more than two years. Benchmark Indian indices clocked robust gains on Wednesday as inflation worries eased amid weakness in crude prices. Sensex closed 616.62 points or 1.16% higher at 53,750.97, and the Nifty rose 178.90 points to 15,989.80. Auto, FMCG, IT and banks & financials led the rally in the market today. Broad market indices were positive as the BSE midcap index rose 1.7%, and BSE Smallcap index gained around 1%. Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, and HUL were among the top gainers on the indices. Power Grid Corp, NTPC were among the major losers. Meanwhile, the Indian rupee recovered marginally to close at 79.31 against the US dollar. India's latest measures aimed at boosting domestic oil supplies could reduce its diesel and gasoline exports in the second half of the year, keeping global supplies tight and underpinning prices, traders and analysts said. The world is grappling with tight gasoline and diesel supplies as Western sanctions have reduced exports from Russia while demand has surged in a post-pandemic recovery. (Reuters) Bajaj Finance reported a good set of numbers for Q1FY23, Company reported the highest ever quarterly increase in its customer franchise of 2.7 MM. Bajaj Finance has reported its quarterly business update, the company's customer franchise reached 60.3 Mm as compared to 50.5 Mm last year, this is the highest quarterly increase in customer franchise by Bajaj finance of 2.7 Mm in Q1FY23. Along with the customer franchise the company has also reported good numbers for the new loan book which is at 7.4 Mm for Q1FY2023 as compared to 4.6 in Q1FY22. Overall the Q1FY23 quarterly update seems to be very strong for Bajaj Finance and the company is back on its pre-covid growth momentum. We expect bajaj finance to continue this growth momentum for the next couple of quarters. We have a neutral outlook on Bajaj Finance looking at the current valuations and comparing them with peers group. Goldman Sachs believes that Kotak Mahindra Bank stock may go up to₹2,135 per share levels in next 12 months and may hit $100 billion market cap by FY27. Goldman Sachs report says, \"We believe Kotak Mahindra Bank is positioned for an earnings upgrade cycle; we raise our estimates by 7%/13% for FY23E-FY25E on higher margins and lower loan-loss provisions, driving our 12-m TP to Rs2,135 (from Rs1,984, based on a blend of relative P/E and SOTP). We expect core operating profits to grow at a 22% CAGR (vs. a <15% CAGR in FY19-22) and net profits to grow at an 18% CAGR in FY22-25E (21% adj. for provision reversal in FY2022), and our FY23E-25E estimates are c.8% higher on average than VA consensus.\" A rise in public investment in production linked incentive scheme (PLI) has resulted in a growth in hiring intent for July-September as 61 per cent of companies surveyed said they are keen to hire more, according to a report by TeamLease Employment Outlook Report. The government has notified certain procedural changes in the GST rules, including those related to threshold, for filing annual returns for the 2021-22 fiscal, a move that will help ease the compliance burden on small players. The changes were vetted by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council at its meeting last week. With the amendments notified by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), businesses have also been allowed to make tax payments on the GSTN portal by using IMPS and UPI payment modes. (PTI) European shares climbed on Wednesday, as Norwegian oil and gas workers called off their strike and assuaged fears of a heightened energy supply crunch, while Just Eat Takeaway.com rose after Amazon agreed to buy a stake in unit Grubhub. The continent-wide STOXX 600 was up 1.3%. Germany's DAX gained 1.4% after losing almost 3% in the previous session. . Equities fell in Asia on Wednesday and the euro was stuck at a 20-year low as recession fears continued to flow through trading floors. Adding to the uncertainty was a fresh flare-up of coronavirus cases in parts of China that has seen some cities locked down. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 closed 1.2% lower, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.1%. Shanghai's Composite ended 1.4% lower. · Topline growth of 36% y/y (ex-financial & OMCs) is largely driven by E&P companies like Reliance and ONGC, while sectors like Automobiles and IT are also likely to see impetus, estimated to witness a low double-digit growth. Performance in 12 out of 15 sectors under our coverage (ex-financial & OMCs) is likely to see flattish growth in the quarter, indicating that only three sectors are doing most of the heavy lifting. · After seeing three consecutive quarters of contraction operating margins are likely to remain flat (up 15bps y/y) on account of strong margin expansion in Oil & Gas space (excluding OMCs). Auto sector is also likely to witness an expansion after three consecutive quarters of contraction. On the negative side, Cement, Pharma & IT are likely to witness margin collapse by 9.4, 3.4, and 2.3 ppts y/y basis respectively · PAT growth of 74% is predominantly driven by 147% PAT growth y/y for Oil & Gas (ex[1]OMC) space, (accounting for 45% of our earnings ex-Finance and OMC). While, Auto and Telecom, which reported losses in Q1 FY22 are also likely to witness significant positive traction For Financials: PAT to grow at 48% y/y, spearheaded by NBFC · NII for Banks is expected to register a healthy 16% y/y growth, boosted by a decent uptake in credit demand. Even though PPoP is likely to register a de-growth of 1.4% y/y, the lowest number on recent records as an unfavourable rise in G-Sec yield translates into a weak treasury income. Lower provisioning and higher NII will improve PAT by 29% y/y. · NBFC & SFB are likely to witness one of the strongest growth post-COVID. Both the topline and bottom-line are expected to grow by 25% and 145% y/y respectively Credit rating agency Icra on Wednesday said that malls can expect rental income to increase by 30% year-on-year in FY23 driven by improved recovery in business. Malls have reported an uptick in footfalls as well as demand; many retailers have also gone back to pre-covid rentals asmalls report recovery. Near normal economic activity, healthy retail sales (Q1FY23 averaging at ~92% of pre-Covid levels), robust demand in PV segment amid new launches in the SUV domain, cut in excise duty on fuels (| 8/litre on petrol, | 6/litre on diesel) in May 2022 and plummeting key raw material prices (mainly metals) towards the fag end of the quarter post their peak in April-May 2022 were the key highlights for Q1FY23E. Total industry volumes in Q1FY23 are expected to jump up ~10% QoQ led by the robust performance by the industry leader in the 2-W space with rest of the categories (PV, 3-W, CV) witnessing de-growth QoQ. Building in conservative estimates & quarterly lag of RM costs impact, we build in ~50 bps gross margin decline for our coverage companies in Q1FY23E. We expect our coverage universe (ex-Tata Motors) to report 1.5% QoQ topline growth & ~10 bps QoQ margin improvement to 12.2% with PAT expected to decline 9.7% QoQ primarily tracking exceptional gains in Q4FY22 (Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto). However, on a YoY basis, operational performance is likely to be robust at high double digit growth due to Covid impacted lower sales in the base year. The second half of 2022 will be another subdued period for equity capital markets, especially forinitial public offerings(IPOs) with a volatile stock market being one of many macroeconomic headwinds, experts said. Overall fundraising in the equity capital markets dropped to₹1.01 trillion in the first half of calendar year 2022, compared to a fundraising of₹1.26 trillion the same period last year, according to data from primary markets tracker Prime Database. Marico Ltd’s business update for the quarter-ended June (Q1FY23) indicated downtrading across products in essential categories on account of increased inflationary pressures. Saffola Oils volume fell by double digits year-on-year (y-o-y) as consumers shifted their preference from premium to mass segment in edible oils. Plus, it didn’t help matters that Q1FY22 had a high base owing to the increased in-house consumption. (Full report) Fast moving consumer goods maker Dabur India Ltd., expects its domestic business to post “high single digit” revenue growth in the June quarter, the company said in a quarterly update ahead of announcing earnings for the first quarter. A whole bunch of stocks will be in focus this week as they undergo their corporate actions and declare dividend, bonus shares, etc. One of the leading Indian pharma stocks engaged in research, development, manufacturing and marketing of generic pharmaceutical formulations, Torrent Pharma is set to declare bonus shares later this week. (Read here) Stable Demand Outlook and Digitalization to Support Revenue Growth We expect the IT companies under our coverage universe to report strong deal momentum (strong book-to-bill ratio and solid deal pipeline) across most verticals in 1HFY23 due to a strong demand seen for transformation and digitalization, while demand would moderate 2HFY23 onwards. We expect 2.4-3.7% and 2.5-3.7% sequential growth in CC revenue for 1QFY23 for the large cap and mid-cap companies, respectively. Further, revenue growth is likely to be broad-based across verticals. We expect the deal bookings to remain strong, given the ongoing digital transformation trend. Lower Utilization & Supply Side Issues to Impact Margins, but Attrition to Peak Out now We expect the companies under our IT sector coverage universe to report 47bps QoQ decline in EBIT margin due to: (1) accelerated hiring (both freshers and laterals) amid the high attrition; (2) marginal step-up in investment in sales and capabilities, and (3) lower utilization due to hiring freshers (4) higher S&GA cost, due to visa cost and increasing travel expenses. We highlight the margin pressure in 1QFY23 owing to higher employee incentives amid the rising attrition and cross-currency headwind. We expect companies with higher EU exposure to face stronger cross-currency headwind due to likely weakening of GBP and EUR against USD. Though attrition would remain elevated, we believe that it has already peaked out now. We expect cost pressure to continue over the next 2 quarters, while margin would recover with moderation in attrition in 2HFY23 and would stabilise. Additionally, we believe the large cap IT names are in a better position to address supply side concerns along with better pricing power compared to their mid-cap peers. Going ahead, we believe margin expansion would depend on: (1) improved pricing; (2) operating leverage (double-digit revenue growth); and (3) currency movement. IT Names to Maintain FY23 Revenue Growth Guidance We expect the IT companies to maintain revenue guidance for FY23 on the back of a deal backlog and healthy deal environment. We also believe a broad-based consensus exists among the large cap and mid-cap IT companies regarding better technology demand. We expect Infosys to maintain FY23 revenue growth guidance to 12-14% and EBIT margin in the range of 22-24%. We expect Indian IT names to record low-teen double-digit revenue growth in FY23 with minor moderation in margins in 1HFY23E due to cost pressure and currency headwinds, while margins would recover by ~50bps in 2HFY23E. We expect a decline in the utilization rate due to fresher hirings and a rise in discretionary cost. The IT sector (coverage universe) is set to post another quarter of healthy growth with decent CC growth despite cross currency headwinds and cost pressure, based on (1) increasing digital transformation/shift to cloud, 2) healthy deal pipeline, and 3) investment in the hyperscalers/SaaS ecosystem. We expect the IT companies to invest the margin gains that they witnessed over the last 2 years for capability addition and talent retention, which will aid their market share gain over the medium term. We also expect accelerated disclosures on the progress of cloud business. Majority of global enterprises are still at an early stage of digital adoption, which is a huge opportunity for the Indian IT companies for long term. Though FY23E revenue growth outlook for the sector remains strong, FY24E revenue growth would see moderation amid uncertainties on global business environment and worsening macros. We believe high salary inflation in developed markets, increasing travel expenses and higher visa costs would impact margins, despite some relief from better pricing. Post recent price correction, valuations are now below the 5-yr avg and further valuation contraction is unlikely. With double digit revenue growth and likely margin recovery 2HFY23 onwards, we remain positive on the sector despite near-term challenges. The pain for Indian stock market continues, with key benchmark index Nifty falling nearly 5% in June, following a 3% decline in May. The market closed in the red for the third consecutive month in June, marking the steepest month-on-month decline since March 2020, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Compared to other Asian markets, the Indian stock market has seen relatively less correction. For instance, key benchmark indices in Korea, Taiwan and Brazil have fallen over 10% each in June compared to May, in local currency terms. In fact, even the MSCI Emerging Markets index slumped 7% m-o-m in June. India recorded 16,159 fresh coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, pushing active cases in the country to 1,15,212, as per data released by the Union health ministry. With this, total covid cases reported in the country so far stand at 4,35,47,809. About 28 people succumbed to the disease in the last 24 hours, pushing the death toll to 525,270. Customer Franchise – Customer franchise stood at 60.3Mn( +19.4% YoY/ +4.7% QoQ). New customer acquisition improved and stood at 2.7mn(22.7% QoQ). Both these parameters have shown improvement over Q4’22 when there was a +3.9%QoQ rise in customer franchise and a 14% decrease QoQ in new customer acquisition AUM- Core AUM showed strong growth and came in at INR 20,40,000 Mn ( +30.7% YoY/+6.19% QoQ) New loans booked at 7.4Mn vs 4.6Mn in Q1’22 and 6.3Mn in Q4’22 Deposits came in at INR 3,41,000 Mn( +22% YoY/ +10.7% QoQ) . Deposit momentum has been strong last quarter had seen only a +2.6% QoQ rise. Outlook: AUM growth was strong but slightly below our expectation of 9% QoQ growth but customer acquisition has rebounded strongly after it had seen a de-growth in the last quarter which is a strong positive. Increasing customer acquisition through its omni channel is crucial and company has been successful in doing so We have a BUY rating valuing the company at 8.7x Sep’24E ABV with TP at₹8,953. On the technical front, 15650-15700 holds the demand zone for the index, and any correction could be seen as a buying opportunity. On the contrary, a decisive closure above the 16000 mark could only ascertain the bullish trend in the near period.

    "body": "Market Today:The frontline indices on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE) erased their intraday gains and ended around 0.5 per cent lower on Thursday on expiry of August-series futures and options (F&O) contracts. The S&PBSE Sensexcrashed 310.71 points (0.53 per cent) to end at 58,774.72 while theNifty 50declined 82.50 points (0.47 per cent) to settle at 17,522.45. Both the indices had opened over 0.4 per cent earlier in the day and traded higher for the bulk of the session rising around 0.7 per cent before giving up their gains and ending lower in the last hour of trade. On the Sensex pack,Bajaj Finance,Infosys,Tata Consultancy Services(TCS),IndusIndBank, Axis Bank, Power Grid Corporation of India, NTPC, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) were the top losers on Thursday whileMaruti SuzukiIndia, State Bank of India (SBI) and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories ended higher. Among the sectoral indices, the Nifty IT index fell 0.87 per cent, Nifty Metal index slipped 0.51 per cent and Nifty Pharma declined 0.40 per cent. On the other hand, the Nifty PSU Bank index rose 2.74 per cent and Nifty Realty climbed 1.47 per cent. In the broader market, the S&P BSE MidCap index ended at 25,019.90, up 50.56 points (0.20 per cent) while the S&P BSE SmallCap settled at 28,315.61, up 48.97 points (0.17 per cent). The volatility index or India VIX on NSE climbed 6.18 per cent to 19.57. Summing up the market, Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities noted, “Nifty fell on Aug 25, snapping a two day rise, on the monthly F&O expiry day, disregarding the mild gains in markets elsewhere. Nifty opened gap up and rose mildly in the morning. Post 1415 Hrs, a sell-off was seen in the Nifty leading it to close 0.47 per cent or 82.5 points lower at 17522.5. Among sectors, Realty and Consumer Durables were the main gainers while IT was the main loser. Broad market performed better than the Nifty as is evident from the positive close in Smallcap and Midcap indices and by the positive advance decline ratio.” Commenting on the Nifty he said, “Nifty has formed a bearish engulfing top on daily charts and seems to have formed a lower high on short term basis. Unless the high of 17,727 is breached, Nifty could witness declines/sell on rallies. A downward breach of 17,345 could lead to acceleration in the fall.” Share markets pushed higher and Europe’s bond markets and euro stole a breather from energy-price driven sell-offs on Thursday, as investors waited to hear the latest reaction of the world’s top central bankers to soaringinflation. Asia had tailgated Wall Street higher overnight and Europe’s bourses did the same as oil and gas stocks made another 1.5 per cent jump amid intensifying worries of a Russian gas supply crisis. The 0.7 per cent rise in European stocks left MSCI’s 47-country index of world shares up 0.4 per cent with US stock futures pointing to similar gains for the S&P 500 later. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.7 per cent, after US stocks ended the previous session with modest gains. Australian shares climbed 0.7 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index was up by 0.72 per cent. China’s CSI300 rose 0.8 per cent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged 3.6 per cent in a shortened trading session due to a typhoon. Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed. The brothers Provit and Sorbojit Thaosen were among the victims, along with four others from their village.

    "title": "Sensex hits all-time high: Will the dream run continue?",
    "body": "Benchmark index S&P BSE Sensexhit an all-time high during intraday trade on Wednesday, surpassing the previous peak it achieved in 2022. In December 2022, the Sensex achieved its previous all-time high of 63,583.07. The 30-share index rose over 260 points to hit a fresh all-time high of 63,588.31 in early trade but fell shortly after due to selling pressure. The NSE Nifty 50 is also eyeing a fresh record and was roughly 30 points away from achieving the milestone at around 1:40 pm. So, what's driving the bull run on Dalal Street? Both benchmark indices have been gaining over the past few months, driven by a host of macroeconomic factors such as lower inflation and stronger growth projections. Persistent foreign inflows have also been a key factor in boosting the domestic benchmark indices. It may be noted that foreign investors have put in over 73 lakh crore so far this financial year. Compared to this, foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the two previous financial years. V.L.A. Ambala (SEBI Registered Research Analyst), Stock Market Today (SMT), said, \"It is another record day in India's stock market. As we had said yesterday, the price was getting ready for a new all-time high, and today Sensex has made a new all-time high of 63,588.31.\" \"We are still in a bull run and the trend is very steep. Fundamentally strong and financially stable stocks are seeing an increase in their volumes,\" she added. Meanwhile, Gaurav Dua, senior vice president and head of capital market strategy at Sharekhan, told news agency Reuters that the Indian economy is in a multi-year upcycle, which is a major positive. \"While there are pockets of overvaluation, pockets of opportunity also exist in markets,\" said Dua. \"The indexes may be at or near record highs, but the valuations are not, thanks to healthy earnings growth over the past 20 months,\" he added. One of the key reasons behind the bull run can be attributed to a sharp acceleration in India's economic growth in the March quarter, in addition to a sharp drop in inflation. With this, the country remains on track to be the fastest-growing economy in the world. Analysts said that the fundamentals of the domestic stocks remain strong, but it is better to wait and watch as upcoming events could provide cues for the future. \"I must say just wait and watch for some time. Right now, I do not see any reason to sell the price except that we are near to an all-time high, so hold it until there is no signal of profit booking,\" Ambala said. \"To be more specific, 62,000 is a strong support level for this bullish movement and if the price sustains at the current range, we will be proudly witnessing Sensex trade in the 65,000 to 75,000 range in this financial year,\" she added. \"Keep in mind that as an economy, we are attracting global interest, and that is a positive side for us,\" she added.

    "title": "Sensex tumbles 500 points: Why is the stock market falling today",
    "body": "Benchmark market indices tumbled sharply on Monday, dragged lower byheavy selling in information technology (IT) countersafter the Donald Trump-led US administration announced a steep hike in H-1B visa application fees. The S&P BSE Sensex was down 503.31 points at 82,122.92 by 2:55 pm, while the NSE Nifty50 slipped 143.80 points to 25,183.20. Volatility surged across broader market segments, with most indices in the red. The Nifty IT index slumped over 3%, leading the fall on Dalal Street. Tech giants including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech and Tech Mahindra bore the brunt of the selloff, as investors priced in the potential hit to margins from the US decision to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. While the shock announcement from President Trump clearly rattled sentiment, analysts say the selloff reflects more than just visa concerns. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, told India Today that the Indian IT sector has been battling a combination of pressures. “While the shock fromPresident Trump’s H-1B fee announcementclearly hit sentiment and triggered a panic in the Indian IT sector, the weakness actually runs deeper and is multi-faceted. Beyond visa costs, the sector has been grappling with a structural slowdown in project spending from international clients and slower deal closures,” Singhania said. He added that the majority of Indian IT revenue still comes from the US market, making it highly sensitive to both tariffs and regulatory shocks. “With tariffs already a major blow to export-related sectors including IT, clients have been cautious in spending on new projects. The H-1B has only added to the uncertainty related to margin pressure for ITs,” he noted. The sudden fall in IT shares has left investors questioning their strategy. According to Singhania, existing shareholders should remain calm and avoid knee-jerk selling. “For investors already holding IT stocks, the sensible approach is to remain calm and avoid hurried selling. The industry is under strain from factors such as regulatory uncertainty and reduced client spending, yet these pressures do not take away from its broader importance in global technology services,” he said. He added that patience with well-managed companies could prove rewarding in the long run, though recovery may take time. “Long-term portfolios can hold patiently, but if exposure is high, partial profit booking might be taken into consideration. The key is to remain watchful of sector commentary, deal wins, and demand outlook.” For those eyeing fresh investments in IT stocks, Singhania advised caution. “For new investors, adopting a wait-and-watch approach would be beneficial. The IT industry is going through a phase of change, with shifting client demand and policy uncertainties still unfolding,” he explained. However, he noted that long-term structural drivers remain intact. “Trends like cloud, digital, and AI adoption are not going away. The current weakness eventually could offer attractive entry points. Gradual accumulation and spreading investments would enable investors to participate in the sector’s eventual recovery while also limiting the risk of catching steep downside and losses.” The sharp fall in IT stocks highlighted the fragility of market sentiment at a time when global policy risks are converging with structural challenges in India’s largest export sector. While the H-1B visa fee shock served as a trigger, analysts warn that the pressure on margins and deal flow could keep the sector under stress in the near term. For investors, the turbulence is a reminder of the importance of patience, diversification, and close attention to global policy shifts that can ripple through Dalal Street in a single session.",

India’s stock market has become accustomed to foreign investors serving as a reliable engine of funds, with a net $59bn of money flowing in over the past six years. But so far this year that trend has reversed, with the market on course for its first year of net foreign outflows since 2011 — contributing to a hefty decline in the value of the rupee as the currency has plumbed to its weakest level versus the US dollar in recent weeks. Yet amid the foreign selling, India’s Nifty 50 stock index has climbed to a succession of record highs this year. Up 7 per cent in the year to date, the market remains near its all-time peak even after a softening in late August. These contrasting movements are the latest sign of the Indian stock market being increasingly driven by domestic investment, while foreign investors have a less powerful role to play, despite their broadly positive view on the country’s economic outlook. For centuries, Indian households have kept their savings overwhelmingly in property and gold. However, growing financial literacy, coupled with reduced fears of inflation, is now driving a surge of domestic money into the stock market. Indian equity mutual funds had net inflows of Rs780bn ($10.7bn) in the first eight months of this year, according to industry trade group AMFI, easily outweighing the net selling of Rs59bn by foreign equity investors. The domestic buying has driven the Indian market’s valuation to unusually high levels, noted Mahesh Nandurkar, Indian equity strategist at CLSA. On a price-to-earnings basis, the Nifty now enjoys a 60 per cent premium to the emerging markets average, he estimated. It is concerned about overheated valuations, rather than India’s economic outlook, that have caused foreign investors to pare their exposure to Indian stocks, said Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers. “The role that foreign investors used to play has been taken over by domestic investors,” he said. “And that has pushed valuations to a level where foreign investors don’t feel comfortable.” But foreign selling in India’s debt market has been even larger, with net outflows of Rs443bn in the first eight months of the year amid tightening US monetary policy. That pushed the 10-year government bond yield this week to 8.14 per cent, its highest level since 2014, while sending the rupee to a record low of Rs72.97 to the dollar. The rupee’s slide has prompted foreign equity investors such as Robert Secker, at M&G Investments, to focus more on sectors such as IT services, which benefit because their revenues are mostly earned abroad and their costs are largely domestic. Shares in the largest of these companies, Tata Consultancy Services, have risen 66 per cent alone in the past year, against 11 per cent for the Nifty as a whole. And while the rupee’s slide has depressed foreign investors’ Indian returns in dollar terms, Mr Secker added, the country’s domestically focused economy means it is seen as a relative safe haven at a time when investors are worrying about emerging trade wars. India has its own trade headaches — notably its heavy reliance on imported oil, where rising prices have been a key factor behind the growing current account deficit that has helped sap the rupee’s value. Other metrics look more promising, said Sunny Ng, a fund manager at PineBridge Investments, highlighting the country’s “stellar” economic growth of 8.2 per cent in the second quarter. Some recent policy changes have also boosted sentiment, he added, such as a new bankruptcy code that should help boost credit growth by giving added protections to lenders. Overseas investors turn away from Indian stocks Subtitles unavailable In contrast, Indian regulators recently sparked outrage by announcing rules that barred entities owned by Indian-origin people from acting as foreign portfolio investors. An advisory panel has since advised the regulator to reconsider the move, but no reversal has yet been announced. “Whenever the stock market is roaring, the regulators tend to adopt an attitude that we don’t really need foreigners and their money,” Mr Mukherjea said. But while such heavy-handed interventions may unsettle foreign investors, he added, the soaring valuations driven by domestic inflows were having a more meaningful restraining effect on overseas investment. “Foreign investors face a richly valued market at a time when [other emerging markets] have pulled back 20 per cent,” he said. “So if you’re sitting in London, you’ll be hard pressed to explain to your CEO why you’re pumping money into India.” Reuse this content (opens in new window) Comments Jump to comments section Promoted Content Latest on India Behind the Money podcast 23 min listen The unsustainable boom in India’s Silicon Valley India Business Briefing Pakistan, protests and public opinion: Narendra Modi's terrible year Premium content Artificial intelligence Global AI giants target India’s youth in emerging market push India Business Briefing Nandan Nilekani: AI will transform Indian education and agriculture Premium content News in-depth Indian business & finance India’s polo-playing steel tycoon behind bid for Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit US immigration Trump’s H-1B visa turmoil threatens Indians’ American dream FT News Briefing podcast 11 min listen Oracle’s leadership shake-up India Business Briefing Not quite a death knell: India’s tech sector and Trump’s new H-1B rules Premium content Follow the topics in this article Currencies Add to myFT Asia-Pacific equities Add to myFT Indian business & finance Add to myFT Emerging market investing Add to myFT Equities Add to myFT Comments",

    "body": "This Article is From Dec 23, 2018 Indian Stock Market Now Bigger Than Germany's India edged past the equity market of Europes largest economy for the first time in seven years Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email The move reflects India's positive returns this year. India's ascent on the global stage has claimed another victory after its stock market overtook Germany to become the seventh largest in the world. India edged past the equity market of Europe's largest economy for the first time in seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That means, after the UK leaves the European Union in March, the bloc would have only one country -- France -- among the seven biggest markets. India and Germany's market capitalization The move reflects India's positive returns this year as companies' reliance on domestic demand enabled them to avoid the meltdown in other emerging markets spurred by Federal Reserve tightening and a trade war between the U.S. and China. It also highlights the challenges facing the EU, including its future relationship with the UK, a standoff with Italy over budget allocations and separatist clashes in Spain. While the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is heading for a 17 per cent decline this year, India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent after seesawing throughout the year amid oil-price volatility. India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent In a year dominated by trade protectionism and punitive tariffs by Donald Trump's administration on China, it's little wonder that investors have turned cautious over countries with a heavy dependence on exports. Germany derives more than 38 per cent of its gross domestic product from exports, based on 2017 data from World Bank. The corresponding ratio for India is only 11 per cent, meaning much of the stock-market opportunity in the country comes from domestic consumer stories. Add NDTV As A Trusted Source The reliance on local demand and entrepreneurship also puts India ahead in growth sweepstakes. The south Asian nation is projected to grow 7.5 per cent this year and 7.3 per cent in 2019, a far cry from German growth of 1.6 per cent for each year.

    "title": "Global markets wobbled while Indian indices produced a higher return",
    "body": "Investors found that when world stock markets were volatile, India's two indices showed calm with a good return. Historical return, volatility earnings ratio data of last year showed that Indian Stock Market was doing well with respect to various international counterparts including Europe's FTSE and USA's Nasdaq indices. India's most vibrant index Nifty produced 12.18 per cent in a year (as on May 31, 2019). At the same time, global stock markets had been struck with various factors, including slowing world economy, less support from central banks and trade tensions. In this period, Hang Seng index of Hong Kong recorded negative 13.07 per cent followed by Singapore Strait Times index (-10.17 per cent), Japan's Nikkei (-9.21 per cent), Europe' FTSE (-7.49 per cent) and Nasdaq (-2.02 per cent). However, USA's DOW index registered only 0.01 per cent return for the period of June 2018 to May 2019. Investors always look at three factors to balance their investment decisions - returns, volatility and price-earnings ratio; all these factors have favoured Indian indices. Annualised volatility data shows that India's stock indices are less volatile than the world's top stock markets, including the USA'S Nasdaq and China's Shanghai Composite Index. China Shanghai Composite Index is the highest volatile market. Annualised volatility for June, 2018 to May, 2019, the Shanghai Composite index witnessed 21.5 per cent volatility followed by US Nasdaq (19.4 per cent). \"Chinese equity markets are no strangers to large swings. Long-term measures of volatility indicate annual levels near 33 per cent and 54 per cent for offshore and onshore markets respectively\" (based on quarterly data), Standard Chartered Bank said in its global market outlook. The Indian indices -- Sensex and Nifty -- recorded the lowest annualised volatility to 12.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent, respectively, for the period of June, 2018 to May, 2019. \"The performance of Indian capital market compares favourably with the other major global economies on various parameters such as indices returns, volatility and currency movements,\" Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, SEBI, India's capital market regulator said. India also ranked top in the criteria of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which gives an idea to investors that index is over or undervalued. Higher P/E means that higher earnings expectations in the future compared to lower P/E. Indian market recorded top rank in terms of P/E. Nifty P/E ratio at 29.5, which was the highest across the world indices during June, 2018 to May, 2019, Sebi data shows. The growing financial integration with fast cross-border mobility of private capital inflows leads the rally in Indian market experts said that shift in the leverage preference of companies from debt to equity finance. Rajiv Singh, CEO, Karvy stock broking Ltd explains to India Today that \"post demonetisation, domestic inflows have become more robust and domestic institutions have stepped in whenever FII's have sold. The trade war has helped as India is thought of as a safe haven among peers. Lastly, subdued oil prices have helped Indian markets perform better than other EM's\". India has outperformed peers on account of multiple reasons, firstly, the election of a stable reform-oriented government, coupled with the long term growth story for Indian equities has made India an attractive destination for global investors. India has outperformed emerging markets by 5.5 per cent in the last one year, of which 4.5 per cent rally occurred on the day after exit polls were announced.

    "body": "The stock market recovered by half its morning losses as fears gave way to calm in the wake of the Indian attack on posts of Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad. The 30-share BSE Sensex was down 170 points at 1320 IST in today’s session, after having been down over 300 points earlier. As against only four shares being up in the morning, 11 were in the green more than half-way through the session. Tata Motors was the top gainer with a rise of 2.8%, followed by Tata Consultancy Services at 2%. All indices are in the red in today’s trade as investors were spooked by reports that Indian fighter jets had entered Pakistan in the wee hours and destroyed training camps, killing 200-300 terrorists. The BSE Sensex touched a low of 35,714.16 in the ongoing session. According to ANI, the Indian Air Force’s Mirage 2000 fighter jets bombed Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area at 0330 IST. The attack comes 12 days after a bomber belonging to Pakistani terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad killed 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force. As per reports, the terror launch pads of the banned outfit were completely destroyed in the attack. The Indian jets are reported to have returned safely without there being any casualty. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told mediapersons that civilian casualties were avoided, adding that the Indian side had information that the JeM planned more attacks and hence this response had become unavoidable. The strike assumes significance because this is the first time India has used its air force for a pre-emptive strike inside Pakistan. The IAF has put on high alert all air defence systems along the international border and the Line of Control to respond to any possible action by the Pakistan air force.

    "title": "Sensex today falls over 700 points and then recovers all losses",
    "body": "Indian stock markets ended flat in a volatile session, after falling sharply in early trade. Intra-daySensexfell over 700 points when it hit 51,601 at day's low but later ended 21 points higher at 52,344. Similarly, Nifty settled flat at 15,683, after sliding below 15,500 at day's low. The broader markets however ended weak with BSE midcap, smallcap indices falling over 0.7% and 0.9% respectively. The rupee also rebounded today from intra-day losses to settle at 73.86 against US dollar. Avinash Gorakshkar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, attributed the jitteriness in markets to two reasons: Fed changing its stance on interest rate earlier this week and China announcing to use its metal reserves to check metal price rise. Investor also weighed a sharp drop in commodity prices which have been pressured by China's plan to sell reserves and a firm dollar. The Nifty metal index fell nearly 1% today with Vedanta, JSW Steel and SAIL falling over 3% each. \"The market continued to be in the consolidation phase witnessing broad-based selling, taking cues from the Fed policy and mixed global markets. US bond yields have cooled off from its high as global markets seem to have digested the latest Fed comments. China’s plan to sell metal reserves to check recent price hikes has pulled down the sector's sentiments,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. \"The market is likely to continue in the consolidation phase for a short while, which can be an opportunity for investors to buy on dips,\" he added. ONGC was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding around 4%, followed by NTPC, PowerGrid, M&M, Nestle India, SBI and HCL Tech. On the other hand, HUL, Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finserv were among the gainers. \"Nifty halted a four-week winning streak as it ended the week 0.73% lower. Panic selling has been absorbed well so far in the markets and local investors have taken these sell-offs as an opportunity to add to their positions. Absence of a sharp selloff in global markets is helping keep sentiments steady here. Follow through buying however may be selective and index gains from hereon may be relatively slow. On the upside the Nifty could face resistance at 15750 while 15430 could provide support on downmoves,\" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

    "title": "Sensex registers biggest one-day fall in 4.5 years, plunges 1,942 points on coronavirus fears, oil price crash",
    "body": "Share/Stock Market Today Live Updates:The benchmark equity indices on the BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) tanked around 5 per cent lower on Monday, registering their biggest one-day fall since August 2015, tracking the weakness in the global markets which tumbled due to rising concerns over the economic impact of coronavirus outbreak and crashing crude oil prices. The S&PBSE Sensexfell 1,941.67 points (5.17 per cent), its worst fall since August 24, 2015, to settle at 35,634.95, its lowest level since February 19, 2019.

Among the stocks on Sensex, shares of oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL) declined 13 per cent to end at Rs 1,105 apiece on Monday. The stock had crashed 13.79 per cent to Rs 1,094.95 per share in the intraday trade, its lowest level since August 2019. This apart, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) too declined 16.55 per cent to settle at Rs 74.40 per share.

The stock markets have been on a downward spiral since the past two weeks ascoronaviruscases in the country have risen sharply and the ongoing developments in the banking space regardingYes Bankduring the past weekend. The number ofcoronavirus cases in Indiaso far has risen to 43 as on Monday, after four fresh cases werereported from Jammu and Kashmir, NewDelhiand Uttar Pradesh and Kerala, respectively, officials in the health ministry said.

SBI shares slid 6.19 per cent to end at Rs 253.70 on the BSE. “Risk of recession increased fuelled by crash in crude oil prices and increasing virus cases outside China. Even though fall in crude oil prices is positive for India in the long term, short term concerns weighed with FII outflow in emerging markets. Coronavirus fear is intensifying and fresh travel bans seems to hurt the global economic sentiments more than feared,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said in an aftermarket statement. Going ahead, the equity markets in India will be shut on Tuesday on account of Holi. The rupee breached the 74-mark against the US dollar as it had opened 25 paise lower against the greenback at 74.03 on Monday. During the intraday trade, it further slipped to 74.18 against the US currency, however, it pared some of its losses and was last seen hovering around 74.05-74.06 levels in late afternoon deals. Oil prices lost as much as a third of their value on Monday in their biggest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War after Saudi Arabia signalled it would hike output to win market share when the coronavirus has already left the market oversupplied. Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling prices and made plans to ramp up crude output next month after Russia balked at making a further steep output cut proposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stabilise oil markets. Brent crude futures were down 22 per cent at $37.05 a barrel by 1000 GMT, after early dropping by as much as 31 per cent to $31.02, their lowest since February 12, 2016. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell by more than 24 per cent, to $33.20 a barrel, after initially falling 33 per cent to $27.34, also the lowest since February 12, 2016. Global stocks plunged on Monday and prices for crude oil tumbled as much as 33 per cent after Saudi Arabia launched a price war with Russia, sending investors already panicked by the coronavirus fleeing for the safety of bonds and the yen. European markets suffered hefty losses in early trade with London dropping more than 8 per cent, Frankfurt falling more than 7 per cent and Paris almost matching those losses. The pan-regional STOXX 600 tumbled into bear market territory — a drop of more than 20 per cent from recent peaks. The number of people infected with the coronavirus topped 110,000 across the world as the outbreak reached more countries and caused more economic carnage. In Asia, the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 4.4 per cent in its worst day since August 2015, while Shanghai blue chips fell 2.9 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 5.1 per cent and Australia’s commodity-heavy market closed down 7.3 per cent, its biggest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.

    "title": "Market cap of BSE firms hits a record $3 trillion as stocks rally",
    "body": "India’s stock market capitalization hit $3 trillion on Friday, fuelled by a rally in small and mid-cap stocks on the BSE. This comes even as the BSE Sensex remains 4% below its February peak, pulled down by large-cap stocks that make the benchmark index. In rupee terms, India’s current market value is pegged at₹218.05 trillion, raising investors’ wealth by₹30.01 trillion or $42.01 billion this year, despite pandemic worries and localized curbs affecting sentiments. In May itself, the market cap of BSE companies swelled by₹11.03 trillion or $19.62 billion. After two days of lacklustre trading following weak global equities, markets rallied on Friday, encouraged by easing covid concerns and a strengthening rupee. The Sensex closed 975.62 points or 1.97% higher at 50,540.48, while the Nifty ended 269.25 points or 1.81% higher at 15,175.30. At closing, the BSE had a market capitalization of $2.99 trillion. The only other countries that have a stock market capitalization of more than $3 trillion are the US, China, Hong Kong, Japan, UK, France, and Canada. BSE’s record market capitalization comes at a time when foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been dumping Indian equities. Since 23 March, FIIs have sold Indian shares worth nearly $2.48 billion. However, domestic institutional investors, including mutual funds and insurance companies, continue to invest, thanks to abundant liquidity and optimism about mid- and small-cap stocks. According to analysts, the Nifty and the Sensex have been consolidating since mid-January, driving liquidity into midcap and small-cap segments. Also, with most large-caps fairly valued, value investors started moving down the market cap pyramid. From their 52-week lows, BSE MidCap has advanced 92%, BSE Smallcap 121% and BSE 500 75%. “As domestic covid cases fell below the three-lakh mark for the fifth day in a row since mid-April, helped by the extended lockdowns by major states, sentiments have turned buoyant. Hopes have accelerated that soon restrictions/curbs would be eased once cases decline further. Visibility on the economic recovery front improved as industrial activities largely continued even during the lockdown, and now, with restrictions likely to ease, consumer demand is expected to make a comeback. Thus, investors are heading more for mid-cap stocks as growing risk appetite, and cheaper valuations of these companies compared to large-cap peers have revived their popularity,” said Siddharth Khemka, head of retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The March quarter performance of good mid-cap and small-cap companies were also way ahead of Street estimates despite rising input costs, mostly due to higher revenues and various cost control measures. Analysts expect earnings to support the market valuation further while keeping an eye on covid-19 cases and vaccination progress. “India’s valuation premium with respect to MSCI emerging markets has remained stable at 40-45% over the last four months, indicating that the rally has been a global one. The headline valuations for the Nifty Midcap 100 suggest that we are in an acceptable zone that can act as a platform for the broader markets to do better from hereon. Midcaps in a growing market with market leadership and low leverage can be equally attractive investment option as any large-cap,” Tata Mutual Fund said. Meanwhile, the rupee rose for the second straight day to close at a two-month high. The domestic currency closed at 72.84 against the US dollar from its previous close of 73.11.

    "title": "With $3.16674 trillion MCap, Indian stock market beats its British peer",
    "body": "India has outgrown the United Kingdom in terms of market capitalisation for the first time to become the sixth biggest stock market amid a sustained slump in global equities triggered by the Russian onslaught on Ukraine. India’s market cap stood at $3.16674 trillion on Thursday as against $3.1102 trillion for the UK, according to Bloomberg data. India lost nearly $357.05 billion in market cap (MCap) since the geopolitical tensions flared up last month, while the British markets suffered an erosion of $410 billion since February 1. The US is the world's biggest market with an MCap of $46.01 trillion followed by China at $11.31 trillion, Japan at $5.78 trillion, Hong Kong at 5.50 trillion, and Saudi Arabia at $3.25 trillion. In Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest exporter of crude oil, stock markets saw a jump in MCap after crude oil surged to historic levels. It added around $442 billion in MCap in the last one month. World markets swung back in the black in the last two sessions after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was no longer pressing for the NATO membership. On Thursday, Indian markets opened in the green with a close watch on the outcome of poll results in five states. Crude oil, too, took a breather from the rally on hopes of positive talks in a meeting of foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia scheduled on Thursday in Turkey. \"The recent rebound (in Indian markets) is in line with the global counterparts and it would be too early to call it a reversal. Besides, the geopolitical updates, domestic factors like state election results will also be in focus. We expect volatility to remain high, so participants should prefer hedged trades,\" said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research at Religare Broking. The Indian equity markets gained for the third session after a four-day losing streak. This was also the second best session since Russia's invasion on Ukraine on February 24. Both the benchmark Sensex and Nifty have lost nearly 6 percent, while both fell 6.2 percent so far this year. Year to date, foreign investors sold around $14.20 billion in the local equity markets. With more central bank meetings coming up in the next week, analysts expect headline indices to move primarily based on macro news. Discover the latestBusiness News,Sensex, andNiftyupdates.

Alibaba has lost $344 billion in world's biggest wipeout Few people could have predicted the downward spiral for Alibaba Group Holding, when founder Jack Ma delivered a blunt criticism of China’s financial system last October. Yet one year on, the technology titan has lost a whopping $344 billion in market capitalization -- the biggest wipe-out of shareholder value globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

On NSE, the volatility index or India VIX surged 4.42 per cent to 20.49. “India’s outperformance till date made a case for profit booking for the FIIs today as geopolitical and currency risks came to the forefront. Practically all sectoral indices ended in the red with the Nifty closing below 17,000 on a day when nothing was spared. The broader markets too saw a steep correction in several stocks which have been defying gravity and moving up since the past several weeks,” said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities. Commenting on the market mood, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Investors are becoming risk-averse due to rising geopolitical turmoil as well as worries about the global economic slump.

    "body": "The market is expected to open in the green as trends in the SGX Nifty indicate a positive opening for the broader index in India with a gain of 73 points. The BSE Sensex was down 221 points to 60,286, while the Nifty50 fell 43 points to 17,722 at the close on Tuesday and formed bearish candle on the daily charts with lower-high-lower-low formation, indicating temporary weakness in the market. As per the pivot charts, the key support level for the Nifty is seen at 17,668, followed by 17,630, and 17,570. If the index moves up, the key resistance levels to watch out for are 17,789, followed by 17,826 and 17,887. Stay tuned to Moneycontrol to find out what happens in the currency and equity markets today. We have collated a list of important headlines across news platforms which could impact Indian as well as international markets: US stocks rallied to a convincingly higher close on Tuesday, but trade was choppy as investors digested comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about how long the central bank might need to tame inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 265.67 points, or 0.78 percent, to 34,156.69, the S&P 500 gained 52.92 points, or 1.29 percent, to 4,164 and the Nasdaq Composite added 226.34 points, or 1.9 percent, to 12,113.79. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell overnight acknowledged that inflation is declining — a sign the central bank may soon pause its rate hikes. The Nikkei 225 fell 0.34 percent, while the Topix gained 0.12 percent. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.68 percent. Trends in the SGX Nifty indicate a positive opening for the broader index in India with a gain of 73 points. The Nifty futures were trading around 17,803 levels on the Singaporean exchange. All eyes will be on RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das when he unveils the outcome of the crucial monetary policy review, the last one for this fiscal, and the first one in this calendar year. Most experts feel that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will hike the key policy rate by 25 basis points, while economists at SBI say that the central bank may hit the pause button, maintaining the current 'withdrawal of accommodation' stance. A host of factors will determine the MPC decision. Oil surges more than 3% as Fed's Powell eases rate hike concerns Oil prices climbed more than 3 percent on Tuesday after the head of the US central bank eased market concerns over interest rate hikes, while recovering demand in China also boosted prices. Brent crude futures were up $2.70, or 3.3 percent, to $83.69 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose $3.03, or 4.1 percent, to $77.14 per barrel. Inflation starting to slow but long, 'bumpy' road ahead: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell US inflation is starting to cool but the road ahead will likely be long and bumpy, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Tuesday, adding that stronger-than-expected economic data could bring more rate hikes. The US central bank has in recent months tempered its aggressive campaign to rein in surging inflation, opting for smaller increases to the benchmark lending rate after multiple steep hikes. \"If the data were to continue to come in stronger than we expect, and we were to conclude that we needed to raise rates more... then we would certainly do that,\" Powell said. Moody's says Indian banks' exposures to Adani 'not large enough' The risk to Indian banks due to the rout faced by Adani stocks are \"limited\", Moody's Investor Services said in a report released on February 7. The exposure of country's lenders to the embattled business group is \"not large enough\", it noted. The ratings' agency, however, underlined that risks for banks can increase if Adani \"becomes more reliant on bank loans\". The group's access to funding from international markets can be curtailed \"because of heightened risk perception\", Moody's said, adding that in such a case, domestic banks may become the main source of funding. This, in turn, may result in \"increases in banks' exposures to Adani and greater risks for them\", it noted. Results on February 8 Shree Cement, Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, Cummins India, Escorts Kubota, Dreamfolks Services, Endurance Technologies, Equitas Small Finance Bank, GATI, Gujarat Pipavav Port, Graphite India, HG Infra Engineering, Honeywell Automation India, IRCON International, ITD Cementation India, Minda Corporation, Samvardhana Motherson International, Narayana Hrudayalaya, Oberoi Realty, Piramal Enterprises, Speciality Restaurants, Symphony, Tracxn Technologies, Trent, and Windlas Biotech will be in focus ahead of its quarterly earnings on February 8. Foreign institutional investors (FII) sold shares worth Rs 2,559.96 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DII) purchased shares worth Rs 639.82 crore on February 7, as per provisional data available on the NSE. Stocks under F&O ban on NSE The National Stock Exchange has added Ambuja Cements on its F&O ban list for February 8, but removed Adani Ports from the same list. Securities thus banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts have crossed 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.

    "title": "Why is Indian stock market falling? — explained with five reasons",
    "body": "Stock market news:TheIndian stock markethas fallen for five straight sessions. Among the frontline indices, the Nifty 50 index today made an intraday low of 24,210 and lost 590 points in this period. Today, the BSE Sensex made an intraday low of 79,477 and lost 1,866 points in these five sessions. Today, the Bank Nifty index made an intraday low of 50,559 and lost around 2,060 points in these five sessions. According tostock marketexperts, the Indian stock market has been under pressure for the last five sessions as global trends are trading weak. They said that Dalal Street had high expectations from the Union Budget 2024. Still, the Modi 3.0 Government's first budget was just an extension of the interim budget, and there was nothing to cheer the Indian stock market, which was trading at a record high. Apart from this, below-par Q1 results in 2024, FIIs and DIIs selling, and weakglobal marketsentiments are some other reasons that are dragging the Indian stock market these days. 1] Budget 2024:\"There was no surprise in the Budget 2024 as it was a mere extension of the interim budget presented in February. The market was expecting some major announcements that would have boosted the CAPEX expansion plans of the corporate sector. So, the budget is expected to put the companies' earnings under pressure in the entire FY25. This selling in the Indian share market can be attributed to this shortfall in the Indian stock market,\" said Saurabh Jain, Vice President — Research atSMC Global Securities. 2] Q1 results 2024:\"The market is discounting the Union Budget 2024, and the focus is now shifting to the trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has remained marginally below our expectations so far in 1QFY25,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal. 3] Weak global market trends:\"After weak Quarterly numbers from US tech giants Tesla and Alphabet, the US stock market witnessed strong selling pressure, which has trickled down in other global bourses. Asian and European markets are also under pressure due to Gernamy's manufacturing woes. So, weak global cues are also a reason for the fall in the Indian stock market,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities. 4] Trend reversal by anchors:\"To date, DIIs were the anchors of the Indian stock market, but they are also on the selling side these days. So, both FIIs and DIIs are selling their position, which is also a reason for the slide in the Indian stock market,\" said Saurabh Jain of SMC Global Securities. 5] Lowering demand of premium buyers:\"In FY24, we witnessed a rise in premium care and other luxury item sales, but those sales have also decreased in the first quarter of the current fiscal. This means the premium class's purchasing power capacity has decreased after showing some signs of recovery,\" said Saurabh Jain.

    "title": "Indian stock market: 10 things that changed for market over weekend- Gift Nifty, Trump tariffs to US govt shutdown fears",
    "body": "Indian stock market: The equity market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open higher on Monday, despite mixed global market cues. Asian markets traded mixed, while the US stock market ended higher last week, after inflation data. This week, investors will focus on keystock market triggers, including the RBI monetary policy, India-US trade deal, developments over US tariffs, domestic and global macroeconomic data, flow of foreign funds, trends in gold prices, and other key geopolitical developments. On Friday, the Indian stock market sharply ended lower, extending its losing streak for the sixth straight session, as fresh Trump tariffs on pharmaceuticals and persistent foreign fund outflow weighed on market sentiment. TheSensexdeclined 733.22 points, or 0.90%, to close at 80,426.46, while the Nifty 50 settled 236.15 points, or 0.95%, lower at 24,654.70. “We expect markets to remain under pressure in the near term, tracking global headwinds, key macroeconomic data, and potential development around the India–US trade talks,” said Siddhartha Khemka - Head of Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asia markets traded mixed on Monday as investors braced for a possible shutdown of the US government. Japan’sNikkei 225fell 0.68%, and the Topix declined 1.27%. South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.05% and the Kosdaq rose 0.82%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures indicated a higher opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 24,810 level, a premium of nearly 120 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a gap-up start for the Indian stock market indices. US stock market ended higher on Friday after mostly in-line US inflation data, but the three major indexes posted losses for the week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq snapping three-week streaks of weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 299.97 points, or 0.65%, to 46,247.29, while the S&P 500 rallied 38.98 points, or 0.59%, to 6,643.70. The Nasdaq Composite closed 99.37 points, or 0.44%, higher at 22,484.07. For the week, theDow Jonesfell 0.2%, the S&P 500 declined 0.3% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.7%. Nvidia share price gained 0.28, Apple shares fell 0.55%, Tesla stock price rallied 4.02%, while Eli Lilly rose 1.4%. Costco Wholesale shares fell 2.9% and Electronic Arts shares jumped 14.9%. Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine early on Sunday, killing at least four people and injuring dozens, in one of the most sustained attacks on the capital since the full-scale war began. Russia’s defence ministry said it had carried out a ‘massive’ attack on Ukraine using long-range air- and sea-based weapons and drones to target military infrastructure, including airfields. The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure edged up in August. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index increased 0.3% in August after gaining 0.2% in July. In the 12 months through August, the PCE Price Index advanced 2.7%. That was the biggest year-on-year increase since February and followed a 2.6% rise in July. US consumer spending increased slightly more than expected in August. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.5% advance in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5%. US government shutdown date is approaching fast. President Donald Trump will meet with the top Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress to discuss extending government funding. The last date for the government funding is September 30. Without a deal a shutdown would begin from October 1, which is also when new US tariffs on heavy trucks, pharmaceuticals and other items go into effect. The US dollar was on the defensive ahead of a slew of economic data releases. The US dollar index was steady at 98.134. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.2% to 149.24, after having risen over 1% against the Japanese currency last week, Reuters reported. The euro rose 0.15% to $1.1717, while sterling edged 0.11% higher to $1.3418. Gold prices traded higher after notching a sixth weekly gain as traders weighed a potential US government shutdown. Gold price traded near $3,773 an ounce after gaining 2% last week. Crude oil prices fell nearly 1% after Iraq’s Kurdistan region resumed crude oil exports via Turkey over the weekend and as OPEC plans another oil output hike in November. Brent crude futures fell 0.99% to $69.46 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude declined 1% to $65.06 a barrel.

    "body": "Indian stock market: The equity market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open on a flat note Tuesday, following mixed global market cues. Asian markets traded mixed, while the US stock market ended higher overnight, led by a rally in technology stocks. On Monday, the Indian stock market ended lower, extending its losing streak to the seventh consecutive session. TheSensexdeclined 61.52 points, or 0.08%, to close at 80,364.94, while the Nifty 50 settled 19.80 points, or 0.08%, lower at 24,634.90. “On one hand, the overhang of recent US policy actions has eased slightly; however, persistent foreign fund outflows and caution ahead of the MPC meeting continue to weigh on sentiment. Participants should focus on selective stock opportunities aligned with sectoral trends while keeping position sizes under check,” said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded mixed on Tuesday, following overnight gains on Wall Street. Japan’sNikkei 225fell 0.32%, while the Topix declined 0.21%. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.27%, while the Kosdaq rose 0.18%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures indicated a higher opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 24,692 level, a premium of nearly 7 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a flat start for the Indian stock market indices. US stock market ended higher on Monday, led by gains in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 68.78 points, or 0.15%, to 46,316.07, while the S&P 500 rose 17.51 points, or 0.26%, to 6,661.21. The Nasdaq Composite closed 107.09 points, or 0.48%, higher at 22,591.15. Nvidia share price rallied 2.07%, Amazon shares gained 1.09%, Intel stock dipped 2.9%, while Tesla stock price rose 0.64%. Electronic Arts shares surged 4.5%, Lam Research shares advanced 2.15%, Canopy Growth share price jumped 17% while Cronos Group shares spiked 13.15% and Tilray Brands shares jumped 60.9%. US President Donald Trump set a 10% tariff rate on imports of lumber and 25% on vanities, kitchen cabinets and upholstered wooden products. The tariffs will take effect on October 14. On January 1, the tariff rates would increase to 30% for upholstered wooden products and to 50% for kitchen cabinets and vanities imported from countries that fail to reach an agreement with the US. US Vice President JD Vance said he believes the US government is on track to shut down. “I think we're headed to a shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said. President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents appeared to make little progress at a White House meeting aimed at heading off a government shutdown. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem said he was open to further interest rate cuts but the Fed must be cautious and keep rates high enough to continue to lean against inflation that remains roughly a percentage point above the central bank’s 2% target, Reuters reported. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that emerging signs of weakness in the labor market drove his support for cutting interest rates at the most recent central bank meeting. China’s manufacturing activity shrank for a sixth month in September. The official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 49.8 in September versus 49.4 in August, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, and beating a median forecast of 49.6 in a Reuters poll. Bank of Japan board members debated the feasibility of raising interest rates in the near term, with one suggesting the timing may be appropriate, a summary of opinions at the central bank’s September policy meeting showed. Crude oil prices fell on another anticipated production increase by OPEC and the resumption of oil exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan region via Turkey. Brent crude futures for November delivery fell 0.66% to $67.52 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude price was trading at $63.07 a barrel, down 0.60%. The US dollar fell in cautious trading as investors braced for a possible US government shutdown. US dollar index, which has dropped 9.7% this year, eased a bit to 97.948. The euro was flat at $1.17275, while sterling was at $1.3433. The Japanese yen was slightly weaker at 148.72 per US dollar.

    "title": "Sensex falls 400 points, investors lose  ₹3 lakh crore in a day— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Stock market today: The Indian stock market ended with significant losses on Wednesday, September 24, tracking weak global cues. The Sensex closed the day at 81,715.63, down 386 points, or 0.47 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 25,056.90, down 113 points, or 0.45 per cent. Thus, the benchmarks extended their losing run to the fourth consecutive session. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.85 per cent and 0.50 per cent, respectively. Investors lost nearly₹3 lakh crore in a single session as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to nearly₹460.5 lakh crore from₹463.6 lakh crore in the previous session. Weak global cues, the dollar's rise, and persisting concerns over valuations, FII selling and Trump's tariffs kept the market down for the fourth consecutive session. Major European markets, including the UK's FTSE, France's CAC 40, and Germany's DAX, traded in the red when the Sensex ended amid a rise in the US dollar after theUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell'smixed signals on rate cuts on Tuesday. In his speech on Tuesday, 23 September, Powell said that if the Fed cuts its rates too fast, it will leave the task of containing inflation unfinished to bring it under the central bank's target range. With optimism over GST cuts behind, investors have shifted their focus back to valuations, earnings, and tariff chatter following the H-1B visa fee hike. \"Profit booking has been observed in Indian markets post-GST reforms, as investors recalibrate valuations and Q2 earnings expectations. IT stocks underperformed due to H-1B fee hikes, while US trade rhetoric amid ongoing trade negotiations and weak global cues are prompting cautious investor sentiment,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. \"India’s relatively high valuations, coupled with moderation in earnings growth, continue to lead FIIs to trim their positions. That said, structural reforms and domestic growth drivers are keeping the underlying trend constructive. Current headwinds appear transitory, with headwinds likely to ease over time,\" Nair said. As many as 34 stocks ended in the red in the Nifty 50 index. Shares of Tata Motors (down 2.62 per cent), BEL (down 2.16 per cent), and Jio Financial Services (down 2.02 per cent) ended as the top losers. Shares of Power Grid Corporation (up 1.68 per cent), HUL (up 1.36 per cent), and NTPC (up 1.31 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Barring Nifty FMCG (up 0.18 per cent), all sectoral indices ended with losses, with Nifty Realty (down 2.49 per cent) ending as the top loser. Nifty Auto (down 1.15 per cent), Private Bank (down 0.86 per cent), Media (down 0.81 per cent), and IT (down 0.72 per cent) ended with significant losses. Nifty Bank fell 0.70 per cent, while the Financial Services index declined 0.64 per cent. Vodafone Idea (66.84 crore shares), Adani Power (13.60 crore shares), and YES Bank (7.7 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Zuari Industries, Raj Packaging Industries, NACDAC Infrastructure, Machino Plastics, Ishaan Infrastructures and Shelters, Sacheta Metals, Universal Arts, and Incap were the eight stocks that jumped over 15 per cent on the BSE, defying weak market sentiment. On the other hand, Adani Power, Diggi Multitrade, Eimco Elecon (India), and PDP Shipping & Projects were the four stocks that crashed over 10 per cent on the BSE. Out of 4,320 stocks traded on the BSE, 1,602 advanced, while 2,565 declined. Some 153 stocks remained unchanged. As many as 176 stocks, including Maruti Suzuki India, SBI, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, and Canara Bank, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. SpiceJet, Symphony, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, Quess Corp, Praj Industries, Ganesha Ecosphere, and Aurionpro Solutions were among the 76 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, on intraday charts, the Nifty 50 is holding a lower top formation, and on daily charts, it formed a bearish candle, which is largely negative. \"We are of the view that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 25,000 level. Below this, the market could slip to 24,900–24,810. On the flip side, above 25,100, the pullback move could extend up to 25,200-25250. The intraday market texture is volatile; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders,\" said Chouhan. Nilesh Jain, the head technical and derivatives research analyst at Centrum Broking, said the Nifty 50 has now completed a 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 24,404 to the recent peak of 25,448, with the key level around 25,050. \"A decisive move below this level could open the door for further downside towards 24,920, which coincides with the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as the 50 per cent retracement of the recent uptrend,\" said Jain. \"Despite the ongoing weakness, the broader structure remains positive as long as Nifty holds above 24,900. On the upside, a breakout above 25,150 would invalidate the current bearish setup and may trigger a short-covering rally towards 25,300,\" Jain said.

    "body": "Indian stock market: The equity benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are expected to open lower on Thursday, following weak global market cues. Asian markets traded mixed, while the US stock market ended lower overnight, extending its fall for the second straight session. On Wednesday, the Indian stock market ended lower, extending losses for the fourth consecutive session, amid selling across the board. TheSensexdeclined 386.47 points, or 0.47%, to close at 81,715.63, while the Nifty 50 settled 112.60 points, or 0.45%, lower at 25,056.90. “Overall, while festive demand and GST-led structural reforms provide support, currency weakness and global headwinds including uncertainty related to India-US trade deal are likely to keep markets range-bound in the near term,” said Siddhartha Khemka - Head of Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here are key global market cues for Sensex today: Asian markets traded mixed on Thursday, following overnight losses on Wall Street. Japan’sNikkei 225fell 0.11%, while the Topix gained 0.18%. South Korea’s Kospi eased 0.02%, and the Kosdaq dropped 0.27%. Hong Kong Hang Seng index futures indicated a lower opening. Gift Nifty was trading around 25,065 level, a discount of nearly 47 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a negative start for the Indian stock market indices. US stock market indices ended lower for a second straight session on Wednesday, as investors booked profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 171.50 points, or 0.37%, to 46,121.28, while the S&P 500 fell 18.94 points, or 0.28%, to 6,637.98.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which make up about 14% of US home sales, easing to a rate of 650,000 units. The goods and services tax (GST) reforms should help lower retail prices and support consumption growth, the Reserve Bank of India said in its monthly bulletin. The GST reforms should “progressively result in a sustained positive impact through significant gains in ease of doing business, lower retail prices and strengthening of consumption growth drivers”, the bulletin said. Higher seasonal agricultural sowing is also expected to keep food prices in check, it said. Gold prices rebounded, driven by expectations of further US interest rate cuts, geopolitical risks, and a slightly weaker dollar. Spot gold price rose 0.3% to $3,747.59 per ounce, while US gold futures for December delivery gained 0.3% to $3,778.50. The US dollar was steady, holding its overnight gains. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six other units, was at 97.813, hovering near a three-week high. The euro was steady at $1.17425, while Sterling was little changed at $1.3451. The yen was last at 148.62 per US dollar.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty 50 extend losses to 7th consecutive session— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Stock market today:Indian stock market benchmarks—the Sensex and the Nifty 50—ended in negative territory on Monday, September 29, extending their losing streak to the seventh consecutive session. In these seven sessions, both indices have declined by over 3 per cent each. The Sensex ended 62 points, or 0.08 per cent, lower at 80,364.94, while the Nifty 50 settled at 24,634.90, down 20 points, or 0.08 per cent on Monday. The BSE Midcap index outperformed, rising 0.34 per cent, but the Smallcap index slipped 0.17 per cent. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and Bharti Airtel were the top drags on the Sensex, while HDFC Bank and SBI offered the strongest support to the index. The Indian stock market's fall over the last seven sessions could be largely attributed to US President Donald Trump's fresh protectionist measures—an H-1B visa fee hike and a tariff on pharma imports. Relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and the lack of fresh positive triggers are also affecting market sentiment. \"The domestic market concluded a volatile session on a flat note as investors turned more cautious ahead of a holiday-led truncated week and continued FII selling. Lack of clarity in the US-India trade deal and prolonged pressure on IT and pharma indices are near-term concerns for the market,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. Nair observed that investors await the RBI policy outcome on Wednesday, and the central bank is expected to keep the rates unchanged to contain volatility in the rupee. Shares of Maruti Suzuki India (down 1.76 per cent), Axis Bank (down 1.73 per cent), and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (down 1.13 per cent) ended as the top losers. Shares of IndusInd Bank (up 3.07 per cent), Titan Company (up 2.70 per cent), and Hindalco Industries (up 1.65 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Nifty PSU Bank ended with a stellar gain of 1.78 per cent, followed by Nifty Oil and Gas, which rose 1.35 per cent and Nifty Realty, which gained 0.88 per cent. The Nifty Bank index climbed 0.13 per cent. Vodafone Idea (73.91 crore shares), Sammaan Capital (15.67 crore shares), and PC Jeweller (6.97 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Bazel International, Graviss Hospitality, Natura Hue Chem, Vascon Engineers, and Sacheta Metals were among the 10 stocks that jumped over 10 per cent on the BSE. Out of 4,377 stocks traded on the BSE, 1,919 advanced, while 2,275 declined. Some 183 stocks remained unchanged. As many as 146 stocks, including Usha Martin, Tata Investment Corporation, Supreme Petrochem, RBL Bank, Minda Corporation, and Indian Bank, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. Five-Star Business Finance, Vedant Fashions, Praj Industries, and Ramkrishna Forgings were among the 166 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, the Nifty formed a bearish candle on daily charts, and on intraday charts, it continues to show a lower top formation, which is largely negative. Chouhan believes that the short-term market outlook is weak, but since it is oversold, a quick pullback rally is a strong possibility. \"For day traders, 24,800 would act as an immediate resistance zone. If the market successfully clears this level, it could bounce back up to 24,900-24,925. On the other side, below 24,600, the selling pressure is likely to accelerate. Below this level, it could retest the levels of 24,500–24,450,\" said Chouhan. Ajit Mishra, SVP of research at Religare Broking, believes oversold positions may now lead to some consolidation in the Nifty. Strong support is around the 24,400–24,500 zone, and resistance is placed at 24,800–25,000.

    "title": "Nifty ends below 25,000, investors lose  ₹3 lakh crore in a day— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Stock market today: The Indian stock market ended with significant losses on Thursday, September 25, for the fifth straight session tracking weak global cues. The Sensex closed the day at 81,159.68, down 555.95 points, or 0.68 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 24,890.85, down 166.05 points, or 0.66 per cent. Broader markets were also down. Nifty MidCap 100 index slipped 0.64 per cent, while Nifty SmallCap 100 index was down 0.57 per cent. Investors lost nearly₹3 lakh crore in a single session as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to nearly₹457.4 lakh crore from₹460.5 lakh crore in the previous session. Weak global cues, the dollar's rise, and persisting concerns over valuations, FII selling and Trump's tariffs kept the market down for the fifth consecutive session. \"Indian markets extended its losing streak for a fifth straight session as investors booked profits amid persistent FII outflows and uncertainty over US-India trade talks, which is expected to dent Q2 GDP growth. Broad based selling prevailed in the market with heavy selling across auto, IT, pharma, and healthcare sectors, while metals gained on the back of China’s liquidity support and copper supply concerns. Overall, sentiment remains cautious ahead of India’s H2FY26 borrowing and US macroeconomic data, expected to be released over the end of the week,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. As many as 43 stocks ended in the red in the Nifty 50 index. Shares of Trent (down 3.61 per cent), PowerGrid (down 3.10 per cent), and Tata Motors (down 2.64 per cent) ended as the top losers. Shares of BEL (up 2.07 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (up 1.51 per cent), and Hindalco (up 0.80 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Barring Nifty Metal (up 0.22 per cent), all sectoral indices ended with losses, with Nifty Realty (down 1.65 per cent) ending as the top loser. Nifty IT (down 1.27 per cent), Auto (down 0.92 per cent), Pharma (down 0.92 per cent), and FMCG (down 0.50 per cent) ended with significant losses. Nifty Bank fell 0.26 per cent, while the Financial Services index declined 0.53 per cent. Adani Power (15.77 crore shares), Hind Copper (6.16 crore shares), and Finotex Chemicals (3.66 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. TVS Electronics, Natural Capsules, Madhav Copper, Chemcon Speciality Chemicals, Max India, and Akme Fintrade India were the 6 stocks that jumped over 10 per cent on the NSE, defying weak market sentiment. On the other hand, Prudential Sugar Corp and Emkay Global Financial Services were the 2 stocks that crashed over 10 per cent on the BSE. Out of 3,135 stocks traded on the NSE, 912 advanced, while 2,124 declined. Some 89 stocks remained unchanged. As many as 53 stocks, including Chemcon Speciality Chemicals, CreditAccess Grameen, Netweb Technologies, and Lumax Industries, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the NSE. Vedant Fashions, TCS, Route Mobile, Praj Industries and United Breweries were among the 77 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. \"The Nifty has fallen below the crucial support level of 25,050, which also coincides with the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the previous rise from 24,400 to 25,450. Additionally, the index has slipped below the 21 EMA on the daily timeframe, confirming increasing bearish sentiment. It appears that the bulls are stepping back, giving bears more control over the market. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 24,800; a break below this level could trigger a deeper and more serious correction. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,000,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty 50 fall for 3rd consecutive session— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Stock market today:The Indian stock market ended lower on Tuesday, September 23, with frontline indices, the Sensex and the Nifty 50, extending losses to their third consecutive session as concerns over an H-1B visa fee hike and uncertainty over India-US trade talks continued weighing on sentiment. However, expectations of favourable growth-inflation dynamics amid GST reforms, a normal monsoon, and interest rate cuts limited losses for the markets. The Sensex closed at 82,102.10, down 58 points, or 0.07 per cent, while the Nifty 50 settled at 25,169.50, down 33 points, or 0.13 per cent. The mid and small-cap segments underperformed as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.29 per cent and 0.35 per cent, respectively. The overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms stood at below₹464 lakh crore from slightly over₹465 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors poorer by over₹1 lakh crore in a single session. Domestic market sentiment has turned weak due to lingering uncertainty over the India-US trade talks. While both nations remain engaged in reaching a deal, US President Donald Trump's surprise H-1B visa fee hike has raised concerns that a collapse of trade talks could result in more aggressive similar moves from the US administration. \"The Indian stock market witnessed a highly volatile session on Tuesday as a steep hike in H-1B visa fees kept investor sentiment cautious, prompting a flat-to-weak opening. Nifty initially faced selling pressure from the 25,250 zone and slipped to an intraday low of 25,100, where it found strong support. From there, the index staged a sharp recovery to touch the day’s high, reflecting strong buying interest at lower levels,\" Ashika Institutional Equities observed. As many as 31 stocks ended in the red in the Nifty 50 index, Tech Mahindra (down 2.16 per cent), Trent (down 2.11 per cent), and SBI Life Insurance Company (down 2 per cent) being the top losers. Shares of IndusInd Bank (up 2.82 per cent), Axis Bank (up 2.24 per cent), and Bajaj Finance (up 1.93 per cent) ended as the top gainers in the Nifty index. Nifty FMCG, Realty, and IT indices ended as the top losers, falling up to a per cent. On the other hand, Nifty PSU Bank and Metal indices rose by a per cent each. Nifty Bank index rose by 0.41 per cent, while the Financial Services index ended 0.12 per cent higher. \"Sector-wise, autos, metals, and financials gained on signs of robust festive demand post-GST cuts, while FMCG and realty stocks came under pressure from profit booking,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. Vodafone Idea (128.6 crore shares), Adani Power (19.25 crore shares), and YES Bank (8.24 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Banaras Beads, Emkay Global Financial Services, Brand Concepts, and Risa International were among the 12 stocks that jumped over 15 per cent on the BSE. Out of 4,311 stocks traded on the BSE, 1,797 advanced, while 2,354 declined. Some 160 stocks remained unchanged. Despite weak market sentiment, as many as 173 stocks, including Maruti Suzuki India, Tata Steel, Adani Power, Bajaj Finance, Canara Bank, Eicher Motors, and JSW Steel, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. SpiceJet, Symphony, Praj Industries, Pidilite Industries, and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals were among the 66 stocks that hit their 52-week lows on the BSE. Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, believes that the intraday market texture is volatile and non-directional. Hence, he suggests that level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the higher side, a break above 25,250 is likely to maintain bullish momentum. Above this level, the index could move up to 25,350-25,380, said Chouhan. On the flip side, a decline below 25,100 may accelerate further, and the index could slip to 25,000-24,950, Chouhan said. According to Bajaj Broking, the Nifty 50 formed a second consecutive high wave candle with a lower high and lower low in the daily chart. The brokerage firm expects the index to extend the same and trade in the range of 25,500–25,000 in the coming sessions. The immediate support base is at 25,100–24,900, which coincides with the confluence of the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA). \"We maintain the overall positive bias and believe the ongoing corrective pullback presents a tactical buying opportunity within the broader uptrend. On the upside, the index faces immediate resistance at the 25,500–25,600 zone,\" said the brokerage firm.

    "body": "Stock market news:The domestic benchmark indices, Nifty 50 and Sensex, reached a three-week low on Friday, experiencing their largest weekly decline in almost seven months, primarily due to US restrictions on H-1B visas and tariffs on branded medications affecting market sentiment. The Nifty 50 declined by 0.95% for the day, settling at 24,654.7, while the BSE Sensex fell by 0.9% to 80,426.46. Both indices recorded a loss of 2.7% over the week. The IT index dropped close to 8% for the week, marking its largest decline in roughly seven months, following President Donald Trump's implementation of a $100,000 charge on new H1-B visas. The pharma index fell by 2.1% on Friday and decreased by 5.2% over the week after Trump declared a 100% tax on branded and patented medications, set to take effect on October 1. As perAmruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking, the Nifty 50 index experienced significant bearish momentum this week, dropping 672 points and negating the previous two weeks' gains. On the daily chart, the index encountered strong resistance around the 25,500 level before declining, resulting in seven consecutive red candles, indicating persistent selling pressure and a negative sentiment. The index fell below the important 24,750 threshold, ultimately closing at 24,654. The Nifty 50 is now trading beneath its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, and it is nearing the 200-day EMA, signaling a deteriorating technical setup. A breakdown below 24,500 could lead to a further decline toward the 24,400 level (200-day EMA) and potentially down to 24,180. On the upside, immediate resistance levels are found at 24,750, then at 24,880, and finally at 25,000. If the index does not reclaim these levels, the short-term outlook is expected to remain negative. Vinod Nair, the Head of Research at Geojit Investments, noted that Indian equity markets ended the week with a lackluster performance, featuring declines across various sectors. The IT sector faced early setbacks due to concerns regarding increasing H-1B visa expenses, further exacerbated by Accenture's cautious forecast. The negative sentiment intensified as new US tariffs on pharmaceutical goods triggered a significant downturn in pharmaceutical stocks. Smaller and mid-cap stocks experienced more substantial declines than large-cap stocks, indicating strains from their elevated valuations. Looking forward, investors will focus on upcoming US economic reports, particularly those relating to inflation and employment figures. Domestically, the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision and industrial production statistics will be crucial in shaping market sentiment. The fundamental outlook for sectors like banking, FMCG, and automobiles remains positive, buoyed by supportive domestic policies and macroeconomic stability.

    "title": "The Rs 1.5 lakh stock that’s ‘bigger’ than the entire Nifty 50 universe",
    "body": "We have all encountered the familiar sight of a traditional weighing scale at a roadside vegetable vendor or fruit shop. At one end of the scale, weights are gradually added until the beam balances, indicating that the fruits, vegetables, or any other object being weighed matches the exact weight on the other side. This everyday scene got me thinking. What if we could apply the same principle to the stock market? What if we could weigh the price of the highest-priced stock in India, along with the stocks that make up the Nifty 50? MRF – The highest-priced stock in India Which is the highest-priced (costliest) actively traded stock in India? No prizes for guessing, it’s MRF Ltd. MRF brand has become synonymous with tyres. The company is engaged in manufacturing rubber products such as tyres, tubes, flaps, and tread rubber. MRF is a name that resonates beyond the stock market. Iconic cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Brian Lara, and AB de Villiers endorsing MRF bats. ALSO READ China’s export ban is fuelling India’s new gold rush: 3 stocks to watch MRF share price hits 52-week high, here’s why On September 23, MRF’s share price hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,56,400 per share on NSE. Two key factors contributed to this surge: the significant increase in auto sales following the GST cuts, and a recent development at the company’s Tiruvottiyur manufacturing plant in Chennai. The latter saw some employees go on strike regarding issues like the advance payment of annual insurance premiums and the hiring of trainees under various government schemes. MRF termed the strike an “illegal” action and noted in an exchange filing that the plant’s operations were partly continuing with the help of workers not involved in the protest. The company said it is actively working to restore normalcy at the plant as soon as possible. One share of MRF can buy you the entire Nifty 50 stock universe As of 2:15 PM on September 25, 2025, a single share of MRF is trading at Rs 1,50,660 on the NSE. To put this into perspective, when you compare it with the combined price of 1 share of all the constituents of the Nifty 50 , MRF still stands higher. ALSO READ This little-known realty stock is secretly building a Rs 10,000 crore data centre empire The total price of 1 share each of all Nifty 50 stocks is Rs 1,21,004, which includes blue-chip giants like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, and many others. MRF’s market cap vs Nifty 50 stocks’ market cap However, despite its high stock price, MRF’s market capitalisation stands at just over Rs 64,000 crore, which is significantly lower than all the Nifty 50 stocks, barring one. Among the Nifty 50 constituents, only IndusInd Bank, with a market cap of Rs 57,807 crore, has a lower market cap than MRF. Other stocks in the Nifty 50 have market caps exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore. To clarify, market capitalisation refers to the total value of a company’s shares in the stock market, calculated by multiplying the company’s share price by the number of shares in circulation. In simple terms, it’s a quick way to gauge the size or value of a company. Why MRF has become the most expensive stock in India: No stock split, no bonus shares Now, let’s understand how MRF, despite having a relatively low market cap, has become the highest-priced traded stock in the Indian markets. One of the key reasons for MRF’s status as the most expensive traded stock is its approach to corporate actions. Unlike many companies, which split their stock or issue bonus shares to bring the stock price down to a more psychologically appealing level, MRF has chosen not to take such actions. This has led to a lower number of shares in circulation, currently standing at a paltry 30.53 lakh. Shares in float refer to the number of a company’s outstanding shares available for trading in the open market, excluding those held by insiders or restricted. MRF share price performance Over the past decade, MRF’s stock has delivered multibagger returns, with absolute gains of 267.81 per cent, outperforming the Sensex (214.72 per cent) and the BSE Auto index (246.47 per cent). In the past six months alone, MRF has surged by 32.27 per cent, and on a year-to-date basis, it is up by 16.90 per cent. In essence, owning a single MRF share could give you access to the entire Nifty 50 universe, including some of India’s most prominent companies—from Adani and Ambani to Tata and beyond.

    "title": "An international dispute about a popular investment product could shape India's market",
    "body": "A dispute between stock exchanges inIndiaandSingaporehas cast doubts on a popular investment product, and it has raised questions about the future of India’s more than $2 trillion equity market. While the problem — a disagreement about the planned listing of a derivative product — may appear to be a niche one, it potentially affects a large swath of international investors with an interest in India. The contract at the heart of the dispute is the Nifty 50 index futures contract currently traded on the Singapore Exchange. According to industry players, that's one of the primary ways that investors around the world have been able to play the Indian market. The derivative product in Singapore is \"the incumbent, the largest and most liquid\" of futures contracts on offer, Ross Finlayson, on the iShares capital markets team at BlackRock, told CNBC. The National Stock Exchange of India has been providing data to the Singapore Exchange for the derivative product, which is used by offshore investors looking to hedge exposure to the Indian stock market. At present, many regard Indian equities as difficult to access because of the country's tax rules and other roadblocks. Now, that contract in Singapore is set to go away following an announcement from the NSE and two other Indian exchanges that they would be ending agreements to provide market data to overseas exchanges. That would affect the trading of offshore derivatives, including the SGX's Nifty 50 Index Futures. The NSE said the move was needed as derivative trading based on Indian securities had resulted in capital migrating offshore. That was “not in the best interest of Indian markets,” the NSE said in arelease. Following the announcement, the SGX said it would list newly created Indian derivative products, but its plans were dealt a blow by the NSE, which took the dispute to court. That was because the proposal was seen as identical to the incumbent SGX Nifty futures, local media outletThe Times of Indiasaid, citing sources. For now, the issue remains in a holding patter. An Indian court last monthorderedthe NSE toextendthe existing license for SGX Nifty futures for at least two successive contract months after arbitration — which the Indian stock exchange said is expected in February 2019 — is completed. Both the SGX and NSE told CNBC they had no additional updates on the matter beyond statements released last month. Investors have been left with plenty of uncertainty in the wake of those developments. Interest in Nifty futures on the SGX has tapered: Volumes of the derivative traded on the SGX have slipped from above the 2 million mark per month to consistently coming in below that level from March onward. The dispute makes things difficult for investors trying to get exposure to Indian equities, thus potentially increasing costs for those looking to access the Indian market, said Zhikai Chen, a Hong Kong-based portfolio director at Lombard Odier. And even though the NSE's existing license has been prolonged for now, investors are unlikely to wait until the last moment before scrambling for alternatives in the scenario the arbitrator rules in the Indian stock exchange's favor. That's because India has a roughly 8.5 percent weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and those tracking that benchmark need to ensure they have exposure to the Indian market. \"From one day to the next, it's very difficult for these managers to be sitting in a limbo as to whether they know they can access that exposure,\" Finlayson said. There aren't too many alternatives that investors caught in the middle can turn to for now, Finlayson said, citing other smaller futures contracts and less liquid derivatives as examples of options. He added that interest in one of BlackRock's recently launched exchange-traded funds focusing on Indian equities had spiked since the two exchanges began legal proceedings. “Because of this turbulence in the market, no one’s really too sure as to the viability of this new product and the overhanging court proceedings obviously bring it a little more into disrepute as well,” Finlayson said of the new India stock futures the SGX plans to launch. Another potential casualty could be the onshore Indian equity market as liquidity could take a knock if arbitrage trading between the two stock exchanges is affected by SGX Nifty futures being halted, said Dbritto Ronald Michael, senior development manager at brokerage Phillip Futures.

(Image: ANI) 12:50 pm: “Arun Jaitley on introducing LTCG at 10%” “Madam Speaker, currently, long-term capital gains arising from transfer of listed equity shares, units of equity oriented fund and unit of a business trust are exempt from tax. With the reforms introduced by the government and incentives given so far, the equity market has become buoyant. The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and units is around Rs 3,67,000 crores as per returns filed for the assessment year 2017-2018,” Arun Jaitley said. “Major part of this gain has accrued to corporates and LLPs. This has also created a bias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being invested in financial assets. The return on investment in equity is already quite attractive even without tax exemption,” Arun Jaitley said further. “There is, therefore, a strong case for bringing long-term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net . However, recognising the fact that vibrant equity market is essential for economic growth, I propose only a modest change in the present regime. I propose to tax such long-term capital gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh at the rate of 10% without allowing the benefit of any indexation. However, all gains up to 31st January 2018 will be grandfathered,” Arun Jaitley added. “Example provided by the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley” For example, if an equity share is purchased six months before 31st January 2018 at Rs 100/- and the highest price quoted on 31st January 2018 in respect of this share is Rs 120/-, there will be no tax on the gain of Rs 20/- if this share is sold after one year from the date of purchase. However, any gain in excess of Rs 20 earned after 31st January, 2018 will be taxed at 10% if this share is sold after 31st July 2018. The gains from equity share held up to one year will remain short-term capital gain and will continue to be taxed at the rate of 15%. 12:43 pm: Indian equities witness heavy sell-off pressure following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s introducing an LTCG tax at 10%. The benchmark Sensex plunged 463.28 points to hit an 8-day low of 35,501.74 with shares of heavyweight companies such as Infosys, RIL, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, SBI shedding the most. 12:38 pm: Indian stock market crashes!

    "title": "Nearly 50% of Nifty companies trading at a discount; should you buy or stay put?",
    "body": "Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations. About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These includeTata Steel,ONGC,Coal India,NTPC,JSW Steel,IOC,Gail India,Axis Bank,Power Grid, among others. Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether? Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks. A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment. The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time. “We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said. Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names? “One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol. “Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said. How relevant are long term averages? Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts. The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages. “Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol. “It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

    "title": "Market Highlights: Sensex plunges 770 points, Nifty settles below 10,800-level",
    "body": "The Indian equity market on Tuesday closed amid macroeconomic data, auto sales number and global cues. Sensex closed 769.88 points, or 2.06%, at 36,562.91 while the broader Nifty settled at 10,797.90 tumbling 225.35 points, or 2.04%. Investors were worried on economy slowdown, GDP data and merger of the the PSU Banks announced late on Friday. Also, the auto sales data which was released over the weekend likely to increase the nervousness of the Dalal Street. \"Market slid as deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. The consolidation of PSU banks is a step in right direction however, they may take more time before earning benefits from synergy. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflow from foreign investors added volatility to rupee,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. In the broader market, both the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices slipped 1.65% and 1.32% respectively. ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank and Vedanta were the worst performing stocks, crashing as much as 4.45%. On NSE, 48 out of 50 stocks ended in the red zone with Tata Steel and UltraTech Cement taking the top position among the losers. Only Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies were the gainers on the 50-share index. “The sharp fall in the Q1 GDP growth to 5% and the weak core sector growth are the key factors that have caused a fall in the markets as it opened after a long weekend. The continuing negative global cues, the raging tariff war between the US and China, and the likely sluggishness in the economic fortunes of economies around the world have also been behind the rot in the markets here as well as elsewhere. Weak domestic consumption especially rural consumption has resulted mainly from low employment levels and non-availability of finance, which are issues that call for immediate measures to salvage the situation,” said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research- Emkay Wealth Management. Among sectors, Nifty PSU Banks was the biggest loser, falling 4.87%, followed by Metal (-3.10%), Media (-2.59%), Private Banks (-2.34%) and Financial Services (-2.28%). Globally, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.2% in early trade while Japan's Nikkei was flat. The US bond yields were little changed in early Tuesday trade after a market holiday in the United States on Monday. The 10-year US Treasuries yield was flat at 1.506%. Global shares faced headwinds from tariffs Washington and Beijing slapped on each other. Sensex closed 769.88 points, or 2.06%, at 36,562.91 while the broader Nifty settled at 10,797.90 tumbling 225.35 points, or 2.04%. The 30-share index plunged 802 points, or 2.15%, to 36,529.83. Nifty PSU Bank sector is down 4.73% with Indian Bank (-10.88%) taking the pole position among top losers followed by Canara Bank (-10.29%), Union Bank (-8.33%), Punjab National Bank (-8.24%) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (7.07%). Midcap stocks continue to decline. BSE Midcap index is trading 1.55% lower with Indian Bank (10.84%) being the top loser. “Cabinet clears recapitalization of IDBI Bank with one-time infusion of funds by both Government and LIC. Will help both IDBI and LIC, and shows government's commitment to take banking to a sound level,” the government said in a tweet. Shares of IDBI Bank on BSE is up 9.16% at₹29.20. 40 out of 50 stocks on Nifty slipped today with UltraTech Cement, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Vedanta and Indian Oil being the top losers, falling as much as 3.83%.

Shares of Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) touched 52-week high today at₹822.30 and₹2,296 respectively. Infosys is trading 0.11% higher on BSE while TCS gained 0.78%. Gold has historically been a favoured asset class for Indians but billionaire banker Uday Kotak believes there should be a new policy that will reset investor priority to equity, a more productive asset than the precious metal. Kotak said in a series of tweets on Monday why pouring Indians’ savings into gold was not good for the health of India’s economy.

Markets already had rallied on Monday and today after the trends started confirming BJP's win Sensex and Nifty hit their new highs. But now the market will have to catch up with ground realities of the economy and global factors. Global markets are showing weakness due to US-China trade worries and so our market may settle down or even turn negative in the short term. Traders must stay cautious now. Looking at technicals, Nifty has support around 11,730 levels, breaching it on downside might result in more downside towards 11,600, On the upside, any close above 11,800 may take the Nifty above 12,000.

Rising markets make the stocks expensive, and hence it would be not the right time to jump in. Nevertheless, it is also recommended that investors hold on to their investments and wait for their financial goals to achieve. My expectations from the new government for the Mutual Fund Industry are – Scheme portability – The option to switch from one AMC scheme to another AMC scheme within the same asset class should be made available to investors without any extra cost & tax incidence. FOF as Equity Scheme – Revise the definition of “Equity Oriented Funds” (EOF) by including Fund of Funds (FOF) schemes which invest predominantly i.e., 65% or more, in units of Equity Oriented Mutual Fund Schemes. Taxation – Taxation of Fixed Income products and bonds if transacted in the capital market to be similar. Pension Funds – Mutual Funds to be permitted along with tax benefit, management of pension funds. Economy – Fiscal deficit to be controlled and financial discipline to be instilled without falling prey to populist measures.\" 14:03 (IST) 23 May 2019 Nifty PSU Bank index up over 1.5 per cent, top gainers and losers among the PSU banks The Nifty PSU Bank index on the National Stock Exchange is up over 1.5 per cent.

(Source: Comapny release to BSE) 12:51 (IST) 23 May 2019 Surendra Hiranandani, Founder and Director, House of Hiranandani on real estate sector: The real estate sector was in the news in the last couple of years, with the government announcing several major policy initiatives like demonetization, RERA, GST etc which changed the entire landscape of the industry and made it buyer friendly. Housing remains the top priority for every Indian regardless of their income levels, education or any other possible factor and we believe that a stable government at the centre in 2019 will further boost the growth in the sector. We hope that the new government demonstrates concrete action to push investments, increase growth and generate employment. We expect that the new government can do away with unnecessary documentation which will help real estate players immensely. It is important that single window clearance is soon put into practice which will not only resolve operational issues prevalent in the industry but would improve the productivity of the real estate industry. Currently, the permissions are coming at a snail’s pace. Private sector participation in housing is necessary to bridge the gap between demand and supply and for that it is desirable to create a policy framework to minimise and simplify approvals required for the development of a real estate project. Real Estate sector stands amongst the critical sectors in terms of investments and employment and we look forward to initiatives that would further aid to the growth of the sector in the near future. 12:43 (IST) 23 May 2019 Japan's Nippon Life Insurance to raise stake in Reliance Capital-owned asset manager to 75 per cent Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management said on Thursday its Japanese investor would increase its stake in the Mumbai-based asset manager to 75 per cent.

If this trend continues for a longer while, the sowing of key rabi crops like wheat, mustard and chana may get delayed, potentially bringing down their yield as northern India has been witnessing above-normal temperature from March, the month when rabi harvesting commences, during the past few years.

Vodafone Idea Ltd., formed by last year’s merger of the British telecommunications firm’s local unit with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd., has warned lenders that it won’t be able to honor its commitments for long under current conditions, the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private. One of its requests was a temporary halt to loan payments, although no formal proposal has been made, two of the people said. Full story 11:15 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Letâ€™s get realistic about BSNL revival Ever since the press critiqued the government’s Rs 70,000 crore bailout package for BSNL-MTNL, BSNL supporters have called it ill-informed, and one-sided; it does not, for instance, take into account the tens of thousands of crores of private telecom debt that PSU banks will have to write off. Indeed, if the debt owed by telcos to the government is added, the figure could runs into lakhs of crores; while companies like RCom and Aircel are already in the insolvency courts, many believe Vodafone-Idea is running out of funds to sustain operations. And, after the Supreme Court judgment on AGR, you can add another Rs 1.33 lakh crore to private sector telecom debt. Put that way, the argument is a sound one: why is writing off private sector debt okay, but a bailout for the public sector problematic?

What has fueled this debate — and allowed different people to arrive at differing conclusions about the state of unemployment — has been the long delays in the availability of past employment data, even though PLFS tracks employment annually. Full story 10:47 (IST) 30 Oct 2019 Bank employees salary negotiation: What has stalled a settlement for over two years A wage revision settlement for over 10 lakh bank employees and officers has been stuck for two years due to serious differences between the bank management and unions. According to banking industry sources, though there was a broad agreement over the Indian Banking Association’s offer of a 12% hike in the wage cost but the talks were derailed for over a year as four officers associations wanted the inclusion of bank officers of all seven scales in the proposed settlement. In addition to this, now a majority of unions and associations are not willing to accept less than 15% hike which was the case with the last wage revision settlement that was applicable for a period of five years, from 2012 to 2017.

Businesses are expected to face challenges this month onwards due to the lack of clarity on the applicability of this rule, said Pritam Mahure, a Mumbai based Chartered Accountant.

Inadequate government action has often rendered the practice of setting up panels largely irrelevant, while the country’s export growth continues to remain below par and miss targets frequently. Various committees, working groups, inter-ministerial pa-nels have, in the past, suggested steps to address structural hurdles,including elevated logistics costs, inflexible labour laws and inverted/distorted duty structure (especially in textiles), whi-ch continue to cripple India’s ex-port competitiveness.

That makes him something of a rare breed among investors in the nation’s bond market. Gautam, a banker for nearly thirty-five years, is counting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s administration’s past fiscal-track record, which shows it can generate funds to plug revenue gaps. That, he said, would remove a major impediment to a debt rally, which could see the benchmark 10-year yield slip to near a three-year low as the Reserve Bank of India cuts rates further.

(PTI) 14:20 (IST) 24 Aug 2021 Gold eases, hovers above $1,800 on virus fears, easing taper concerns Gold prices eased on Tuesday but hovered above the key psychological level of $1,800, as the rising threat from increasing Delta coronavirus variant cases fanned expectations that the US Federal Reserve might delay easing its accommodative stance. Spot gold eased 0.1% to $1,803.53 per ounce by 0650 GMT, after jumping about 1.4% on Monday. US gold futures were flat at $1,806.30.

    "body": "Indian benchmark indices on Mondayclosed at record highsonce again as market sentiment remains high. S&P BSE Sensex rose 1 per cent or 486.81 points to 49,269.32, while NSE Nifty 50 ended at a record closing peak of 14,484.75, up almost one per cent. A good start to the quarterly earnings season, ongoing vaccination developments and hopes of a higher stimulus package in the US boosted domestic markets in India. Higher foreign fund inflows also contributed to domestic market’s performance today. The rally in IT stocks was a major reason behind higher optimism on the trading floors of Dalal Street. IT stocks led from the front today and remained top gainers on the indices. Top gainers on the 30-share Sensex pack included technology firms like HCL Tech, Infosys, TCS, and Tech Mahindra — all of them had gained between 2 to 6 per cent on the BSE. The Nifty IT index also closed 3.3 per cent higher at 27,027.75. The robust earning performance from TCS also helped today’s rally and boosted markets. The technology giant gained after reporting blockbuster third-quarter results. The company’s shares rose by almost three per cent in morning trade before closing almost 1.6 per cent higher. Read |Sensex tops 49,000 as TCS earnings boost IT stocks, Nifty above 14,400 \"The expectations of results from blue-chips are very high. The global markets are good and liquidity is also coming. The sentiment is so solid that markets are not concerned about valuations. This (up)trend is looking difficult to break,\" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. Another factor that contributed to domestic market optimism on Monday was good news regarding the vaccine rollout. It has been confirmed by the government that phase one of themass vaccination against Covid-19 will begin from January 16. Market participants are keenly awaiting the mass vaccination drive to start as it will further lead to further easing of economic activity. It may be noted that India has authorised two Covid-19 vaccines till date — Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca & Serum Institute of India vaccine Covishield for emergency use. Read |India's vaccine cost-effective, vaccination to begin from Jan 16: PM Modi The first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive is expected to start by January 16 with health care workers, frontline workers and the elderly. There are a bunch of other factors that have boosted market optimism. Higher foreign fund inflows, the possibility of a bigger US stimulus package and buzzing auto stocks also helped boost market optimism. Market investors are optimistic ahead of the government’s upcoming budget, which will be crucial for India’s economic revival. Although the government is tight on finances due to additional Covid-19 expenditure, it is likely to go for higher spending in its budget to boost growth and demand.",

    "title": "Nifty 50 at 17,500 level! What's next? The road ahead for investors",
    "body": "Nifty 50 at 17,500 level! What's next? The key benchmark Indian stock market index, Nifty 50 is swinging at an unprecedented 17,500 levels (approx.) and the free-float market-weighted stock market index, Sensex breached the elusive 55,000 marks recently. The Indian stock markets witnessed the Bull Run and massive rally for the first time ever, and it may make a record of new levels every day. Keeping all this in mind, it becomes extremely important for an investor to do a fundamental check about whether all these unprecedented runs are being supported by basic data or not, and how much strength do these levels possess? Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman of GCL Securities Private Limited, suggests that there is no need to worry about a higher level of these stock market indices because the price of any stock or index is always a reflection of its earning base. \"All of us are well aware of the fact that the pandemic has hit the earnings of businesses very badly. Hence, now when businesses are bouncing back into financial action, the earnings of almost every company is improving in their quarterly results,\" he said. While looking at the consolidated earnings of Nifty 50 companies, it was at almost Rs 358 per share, average in August 2020, and has been continuously improving since then. The same figure was at an average of Rs 446 in April 2021 and Rs 607 in August 2021. \"Therefore, if we look at the PE data of this year, it is continuously on a decline, even though the key indices are touching new levels,\" he said. Keeping in mind the above-cited data, now, a big question emerges here - Is it worth buying in Nifty 50 at 26.25 P/E? To answer this, we have to look into some of the key facts here:- 1. Historical P/E:FY 2020-21 was an exception, therefore we cannot take the data of this year into consideration while calculating the average. However, if we look at historical data of the past 5 years before FY'21, the Nifty 50 P/E average was 24.78 from the beginning of FY 2015-16 till the end of FY 2019-20. Therefore, at 26.25 level it is almost 6% higher than last 5 years average. 2. Nifty 50 P/E calculation:As we know, NSE has changed the calculation method for Nifty 50 P/E. Now it is calculated on the basis of consolidated earnings of all the companies instead of standalone P/E. This calculation has changed P/E data significantly. It is important to note here that after that this calculation change came into effect, Nifty 50 P/E immediately came at 33.2 on 31st March 2021 from 40.43. 3. Future growth:If we evaluate the P/E of any company or any of the indices, we must look at the future earnings expectations as well. Current higher P/E may be a result of market expectations of higher earnings in the future. Conclusion:P/E is the most important factor for market strength analysis and it is running higher than its 5 years average. It may be the result of the market expectation of higher earnings growth of Nifty 50 companies but at the same time, we also expect that earnings will improve further as the festive season will perform well and the monsoon is going good all over India. Finally, long-term investors who have 3-5 years of investment horizon should not fear at all from the levels of 16,500 and 55,000 of Nifty 50 and Sensex respectively.",

Luxury 2 & 3 BHK Near Electronic City Metro. Pay 20% Now! Sobha Townpark • Ad Ad Learn More Undo The Nifty50 turned 25 this year on April 22. It started with a base of 1,000 and is currently trading at 15,867. In its 25-year-long journey, the index has risen almost 16 times its original base. In terms of returns, it has generated returns of around 11.5% per annum for the past 25 years. On the other hand, the BSE Sensex launched in 1979, completed 42 years this year in April. It has generated returns of around 16% per annum for the past 40-plus years. These are no mean achievements. Just Rs 20,000 invested in Sensex in 1979 when it was launched would have made you a crorepati today. Rs 7 lakh invested in NIfty50 in 1996, when it was launched, would have made you a crorepati today. This is the power of compounding, the benefit of staying put and investing with a long term view. Many people who invested similar amounts or higher could have fulfilled their milestone goals like daughter’s marriage, children’s foreign education or retirement. Indian markets, like other global markets, are on a roll since recovering from a crash precipitated by the pandemic last year. Rising cases globally and spread of delta variant, high inflation, and other fears are being ignored by the markets. Indian markets have doubled from levels seen in March last year. In the last one year, Indian markets have generated the 3rd highest returns worldwide. Liquidity, and lack of other profitable investment avenues have made equities most sought after. More than a crore new demat accounts have been opened in the last year. With interest rates on fixed deposits low (around 5.5% for 5 year FD), inflation high 6%+, investors are making negative real returns on term deposits. The real estate market is in a flux. In metros rents have fallen sharply after the lockdown as employees moved back home. Despite the devastation caused by the pandemic, Indian economy has bounced back strongly with GDP growth of 1.6% in Q4 of the financial year (FY) 2020-21. IMF projections for FY 2021-22 suggest India would again become the world's fastest-growing large economy. The growth story for India is intact and we are in a multi-year bull run cycle as projected by many experts like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Raamdeo Agarwal and others. The Sensex could touch 200,000 points in the next 10 years, according to Raamdeo Agrawal on account of favourable factors like steady economic growth over the last few years and key indicators such as democracy, demography, digitisation, dollar reserves, and a stable government. This translates to a per annum growth of 15% which is still 1% lower than what Sensex has achieved till date. Story continues According to ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala , India is on a roll and the stock market will continue to boom. He expects Nifty50 to touch 100,000 points by 2030. This translates into a 20% per annum return which is very bullish in my opinion. A Times of India analysis on 30 years of economic reforms projects the Sensex to reach 100,000 points by 2027 and 1,500,000 by 2051! Both these projections are attainable as they assume an annual growth of 12%, which is equal to historical growth returned by Nifty50. This means that Rs 7 lakh invested in the markets today — Nifty50 or Sensex — could fetch you Rs 2 crore by 2051. You could then become a double crorepati in the next thirty years by the time you retire by investing merely Rs 7 lakh.

    "body": "Welcome to the Mint live blog. Track this space for the latest stock market updates. Indian benchmark equity indices--Sensex and Nifty--fell 3% each on Monday, snapping six days of gains, as investor appetite soured following reports of a new deadly strain of the coronavirus in the UK. The Sensex slumped 1406.73 points or 3% to close at 45,553.96 while the Nifty ended 432.15 points or 3.1% lower at 13,328.40. About 580 shares advanced, 2,381 declined, and 163 shares were unchanged. All Nifty sectoral indices tanked 2-7% each while broader market indices Nifty Smallcap100 and Nifty Midcap100 fell 5% each. The BSE lost over₹7 trillion in market capitalisation today. The Indian rupee, meanwhile, ended 21 paise lower at 73.78 per dollar amid selling pressure in domestic equities. Oil prices tumbled by $2 on Monday, as a fast-spreading new strain of coronavirus that has shut down much of the UK and led to tighter restrictions in Europe sparked worries about a slower recovery in fuel demand. Brent crude was down $2.06, or 3.9%, to $50.20 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down $1.95, or 4%, at $47.15 a barrel. As a measure of abundant precaution, passengers arriving from THE UK in all transit flights (flights that have taken off or flights which are reaching India before 22nd Dec at 23.59 hrs) should be subject to mandatory RT-PCR test on arrival at the airports concerned, the civil aviation ministry said in a tweet. M&M says SsangYong files for commencement of rehabilitation procedure with Seoul Bankruptcy Court. It has also applied for autonomous restructuring support (ARS) programme. Seoul Bankruptcy Court will deliberate and review the application. If the Court approves the ARS, SYMC will continue to function under the supervision of its Board and will negotiate with stakeholders to reach an understanding about a revival package which may include equity and debt financing and other related actions. However, some of its decisions will be subject to Court approval. SpiceJet Ltd and IndiGo promoter InterGlobe Aviation were down over 4% each on Monday on reports of countries banning flights from the UK following the discovery of a new deadly strain of coronavirus. Oil fell toward $47 a barrel -- after posting a seventh weekly gain -- on concern a mutation of Covid-19 discovered in the U.K. could speed transmission of the virus and lead to more lockdowns. Futures in New York dropped around 3% after closing at the highest in almost 10 months on Friday. Housing sales across seven major cities are expected to fall 47% year-on-year to 1.38 lakh units this year on lower demand because of the covid-19 pandemic, according to property consultant Anarock. New housing supply, too, is likely to fall 46 per cent to 1.28 lakh units in 2020 in seven cities -- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata.

AstraZeneca Pharma stock up by 1.3% on receiving Import and market permission for asthma drug in India. Benralizumab (Fasenra™) is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype in adult patients. The receipt of this permission paves way for the launch of Benralizumab (Fasenra™) in India, subject to the receipt of related statutory approvals and licenses. This is very positive development for the AstraZeneca and this drug launch will help company to increase contribution from domestic business. Indian rupee erased some of early losses but still traded lower at 73.68 per dollar, amid volatility in domestic equities. The unit had opened 18 paise lower at 73.75 per dollar compared with Friday's close of 73.57 per US unit It has been more than a year since India’s banking regulator initiated insolvency proceedings against a broke housing finance company mired in governance controversies. The saga of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd’s (DHFL) insolvency procedure has been intriguing over the past one year. The task to find bidders had looked challenging initially and bankers having exposure to DHFL felt resigned to large haircuts in the beginning. Lenders have already made sizable provisions against the account assuming haircuts in excess of 50%. The plight of thousands of fixed depositors also hung in balance. (Read here) Cement prices in eastern India continued to suffer in December on rising supply. Even as demand has been showing signs of recovery, it is yet to reach a level where this massive supply can be absorbed without hurting prices. Dealers channel check by Nirmal Bang Securities Ltd showed that prices in the region on an average fell to₹274/bag in December from₹296/bag in November. One cement bag weighs 50 kilograms. At an all-India level, prices fell to₹334/bag from₹344/bag during the period. (Read here) Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed India's Future Retail's plea that sought to restrain its partner Amazon.com Inc from interfering in its $3.4 billion asset sale deal with Reliance Industries, Reuters reported. Amazon is locked in a bitter legal dispute with Future Group, which in August sold its retail assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries. The deal breaches agreements made in 2019 by Future, according to the U.S. online retailer. In October, Amazon had won an injunction to halt Future's deal with Reliance from a Singapore arbitrator both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes. Future later said the order was not binding, prompting Amazon to lodge a complaint with India's market regulator. Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators on account of potentially irreparable damage, Justice Mukta Gupta of the Delhi High Court said in the verdict. On Friday, Nifty started the session marginally positive around 13760 but it corrected in the first hour of the trade by more than 100 points from the opening level. However, it found support near the 13650 mark and recovered gradually to end the day near the opening level. Just like the recent past, once again we witnessed upmove in the indices from intraday dip and Nifty managed to end the week at its all time high. However, the banking index has been reluctant to participate during this week and thus has shown some relative underperformance. Although there are no signs of reversal yet on the chart, Nifty is currently trading near an important resistance of 13770 which is the 127% retracement of the previous correction on the weekly charts. Since the momentum readings are in overbought zone and the index is trading near its resistance, there could be some time-wise or a price-wise correction in the near term. As far as levels are concerned, 13650 and 13600 are the important supports whereas 13770-13800 is the important resistance zone. Traders are advised to look to book some profits on their existing longs here and trade with a stock specific approach with a tab on the above mentioned levels. The₹300 crore IPO of Antony Waste Handling Cell opened for subscription today and the issue will close on 21 December. The issue follows the whopping investor response to Burger King and Mrs Bectors Food IPOs earlier this month. Antony Waste Handling Cell is a leading player in solid waste management services in the country. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd has received tentative approval from the US Food & Drug Administration (US FDA) for Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg, the generic version of Pradaxa®1 Capsules, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg, of Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. According to IQVIATM sales data for the 12 month period ended October, Pradaxa® Capsules, 75 mg, 110 mg, and 150 mg market2 achieved annual sales of approximately $550.9 million. The Nifty is keeping above the crucial 13700 levels. If we can continue doing that, the markets should be headed to 14000. A strong support lies at the 13500-13600 levels and as long as that holds, the trend of the index remains bullish and traders can utilise any dip to accumulate long positions. Oil fell below $48 a barrel in Asian deals -- after posting a seventh weekly gain -- on concern a mutation of Covid-19 discovered in the U.K. could speed transmission of the virus and lead to more lockdowns. Futures in New York dropped 3% after closing at the highest in almost 10 months on Friday. More than 16 million Britons are now required to stay at home as a full lockdown came into force in London and the southeast of England, with some European countries limiting travel with the U.K. A stronger dollar also reduced the appeal of commodities that are priced in the currency. AstraZeneca Pharma India has received import and market permission in Form CT-20 (Marketing Authorization) from the Drugs Controller General of India for Benralizumab 30mg/mL solution for injection (Fasenra), the company said in a filing to the exchanges. Benralizumab is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype in adult patients. The Centre is likely to invite bids for privatising Shipping Corporation of India this week and buyers will have time till mid February to submit EoIs, an official has said.

    "title": "Nifty at a high, but only 11 stocks are at record levels: A warning or an opportunity?",
    "body": "The Nifty50 hit the magical 15,000-mark early this month and hit a fresh record high of 15,257 on February 9 but only 11 stocks in the index have reached their record highs, so far, in the month. It should not come as a surprise as most stocks are still playing catch up. The 11 stocks that hit their lifetime highs include Adani Ports, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Cipla, HDFC Bank, SBI and UltraTech Cement, data from AceEquity shows Nine stocks like Tata Motors, M&M, L&T, Sun Pharma, ITC and Power Grid Corp are trading at 52-week highs. The rally, which we saw in 2020 and is continuing in 2021, lifted most of the largecaps names in the index but there is plenty of upside still left in many stocks, experts say. “Many stocks are showing that they can lead from here or take rally further such as in FMCG –ITC. In pharma, Lupin and Sun Pharma. In IT, Infosys can lead from here compared to TCS. In banking, SBI. So, there are plenty of stocks in which upside is left and could well turn out to be leaders,” Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman, GCL Securities Limited, told Moneycontrol. “In terms of Nifty target, we see the index heading towards 17,600 in the base case scenario in 2021, and in the best case, it could well hit 18,900 while in the worst-case scenario, the index could be around 15,900,” he added. The Nifty that closed above the psychological mark of 15,000 on February 8 has come a long way after it was launched in April 1996, when it traded at 1,107, with the base year of November 1995 set as 1,000. The Nifty50 took nearly 18 years to reach 7,000, the next 8,000 points come in 6.8 years, Motilal Oswal said in a report. The Nifty 50 Index constituents make up roughly 58 percent of the total India market cap. If we look closely, the sprint to 15k from pandemic lows of 7,600 in March 2020 has taken just 220 days. The sharp recovery has been driven by a global liquidity backdrop, better containment of COVID-19, sharp recovery in corporate earnings and a market-friendly Budget, said the Motilal Oswal report. \"There is plenty of upside still left on the Nifty 50 names. We are looking forward towards 16,308-16,848 to 17,200 for the Nifty50,\" Sacchitanand Uttekar, DVP–Technical (Equity), Tradebulls Securities, told Moneycontrol. Jashan Arora, Director at Master Capital Services, told Moneycontrol that if the Nifty50 move above 15,500, the next target will be in the range of 16,200-16,400 in 2021 Multibaggers: What should investors do? There are 16 Nifty50 stocks that have risen 100-400 percent since April or so far in FY21, data from AceEquity showed. Stocks that more than doubled investors’ wealth include names like Tata Motors, M&M, JSW Steel, Bajaj Finance, HCL Technologies, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, and Cipla. Data suggests that stocks that have more than doubled investors’ wealth since March belong to economy-linked sectors, finance as well as IT. After the recent run-up, investors can look at booking partial profits but the long-term investment argument still remains intact. “Out of the 16 names, one can book profits in the following stocks as they are close to our revised price targets and also trading closer to their peak valuations: Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Auto, Shree Cement and Ultratech Cement,” Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. “We are still bullish on the banking stocks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI. We also like Cipla and Bharti Airtel from a one-year perspective,” he said. Uttekar of Tradebulls Securities said that the stock hitting fresh high with volumes is a good sign, which highlights the willingness of participants to buy quality irrespective of the higher pricing. “Investors should continue to hold these stocks & maintain a trailing stop strategy based on larger degree time frames,” he added. The stock market is more about investing in the future prospect of companies and sectors. The Budget 2021 promised capex in sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, Make in India as well as real estate. Financial services remain the top pick. “Many companies in Nifty50 which have doubled wealth continue to have strong fundamentals and growth prospects. If anyone had invested in these companies in March 2020, they had entered at one of the best times. Despite these companies giving fabulous returns in one year, investors should continue to hold them,” Harshad Chetanwala, Co-Founder- MyWealthGrowth.com told Moneycontrol. “If required one can look at trimming as part of these companies and book profits. At present, it is will be good to hold on with these companies for some more time as a pro-growth Budget after a difficult year, the pace of recovery in economic activities, and reasonable success of COVID vaccination can add more fuel to India’s progress,” he said. Most of the sectors gave positive return in 2020 and with the Budget, which has something or the other for each and every sector, they will not disappoint investors. Hence, picking largecap names which are sectoral leaders will be a safe strategy for investors in 2021, experts say. Given the recent run-up seen in most names, some consolidation cannot be ruled out. But, the long term trend still remains intact. “All the sectors have rallied we can assume that there is not much upside in short term but since the longer-term trend is intact, we may see strong moves post consolidation or corrections in the index,” says Arora of Master Capital Services. Ideally one should focus on booking partial profits in the stocks they hold but it was important to remain invested, he said. \"It is quite probable that India is on the cusp of a multi-year economic expansion cycle. If this pans out, the bull market will sustain and grow stronger. So remain invested in quality stocks in performing sectors,” he said.

    "title": "Markets week ahead: Will Sensex, Nifty 50 continue their winning spree?",
    "body": "Indian markets broadly witnessed a positive week between October 17-21 despite feeble global peers. Sensex and Nifty 50 surged over 2% each during the week as expectations of an acceleration in demand trends this Diwali along with earnings season lifted overall sentiment. Both Sensex and Nifty 50 continued their winning streak for the sixth consecutive day. Banking stocks outperformed their counterparts. In the coming week, trading in stock markets will be allowed for only 3 days due to a long-leg of holiday on the occasion of Diwali. On Friday, Sensex closed at 59,307.15 up by 104.25 points or 0.18%, while Nifty 50 edged higher by 12.35 points or 0.07% to end at 17,576.30. Heavyweights like Axis Bank,ICICI Bank, HUL, and Kotak Bank were top performers due to their Q2 results. In terms of sectoral indices, BSE Bankex surged by nearly 949 points, while Bank Nifty surged over 684 points on October 21. Meanwhile, therupeeedged higher against the US dollar amidst firmness in domestic equities and a sustained surge in treasury yields coupled with RBI's intervention. After cracking 83-mark, the rupee closed at 82.6750 per dollar on Friday. In the past six weeks, the domestic currency dropped by around 4% against the greenback. On the other hand, after holding a bearish appetite for equities,FIIsturned into net buyers in the last two trading sessions of this week with October 20 witnessing the most buying. On October 21, FIIs pumped in₹438.89 crore in the equities, while on October 20 -- the investment was to the tune of₹1,864.79 crore. From October 17-19, FIIs selling in the equities was around₹979.34 crore. From last week, Sensex rose by over 1,387 points or 2.4%, while Nifty 50 soared by nearly 391 points or 2.3% respectively in the week between October 17-21. Compared to last week, the BSE-listed firms' market cap jumped more than₹4.13 lakh crore in the week ending October 21, 2022, to nearly₹274.42 lakh crore. The market cap was around₹270.29 lakh crore by end of October 14 last week. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, \"Despite global weaknesses, domestic sentiment was positive ahead of Diwali and the market showed its resilience, supported by a good start to the earnings season. The benchmark indices have been rising for the last six sessions, aided by stock-specific momentum in IT, banks, and FMCG. The rise in credit growth to a 10 year high of 17.94% YoY as of October added colour to the bank nifty with a gain of 3.8%, while PSU banks gained by 11% during the week.\" Trading in equities, derivatives, commodities and other securities will be shut on October 24 due to Lakshi Pujan (main Diwali) and on October 26 due to the Diwali Balipratipada celebration. Thereby, trading will be allowed only on October 25, 27, and 28. However, markets will open for an hour on October 24 from 6.15 pm to 7.15 pm as part ofMuhurat trading. According to Nair, some profit booking was also seen towards the end of the week as domestic investors maintained their cautious stance ahead of the truncated week. On the global front, a rise in UK inflation to a 40-year high of 10.1% in September added to fears of more aggressive monetary policy by the central bank. As there are no major triggers for the next week, the market direction will be based on global sentiment and the earnings season. Further, Mitul Shah - Head of Research at Reliance Securities said, “The Indian rupee breached the 83 per dollar mark for the very first time, on growing demand of dollars from fuel companies and a widening current account deficit. A rising dollar and strengthening US bond yields only contributed to the weakness. The Indian rupee has fallen ~12% against the dollar so far this year. The market fear that more rate hikes by the US Fed could again harden US Treasury yields which could further weaken the rupee.” Also, Shah said, \"The 2QFY23 earning season so far witnessed healthy revenue growth but higher inflationary pressure took toll on profitability. So far 120/BSE500 companies' revenue grew by 23% YoY, EBITDA increased by 15% YoY while PAT was largely flat on YoY basis.\" Shah added, \"Inflation continues to remain sticky, both, in the domestic and the US economy. India's growth remains strong and expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world, while global recession and downgrading of growth persisted for major economies. The market is looking at US Fed monetary policy meeting scheduled for 2nd November. Commentary on festive demand, inflation outlook and rate hike will be keenly watched in the near term.\" Some of the major Q2 earnings to watch in the week of October 24-28 are -- Dabur, Tata Chemicals, Indus Tower, SBI Card, REC, and PNB Housing Finance among others.

    "body": "Benchmarkstock marketindex Nifty 50 opened at an all-time high on Wednesday as domestic markets gained momentum, tracking positive global cues and a strong uptick in Adani Group stocks. In pre-open trade, the Nifty 50 rose 0.48 per cent to 18,908.15, surpassing its previous all-time high of 18,887.30. Today's milestone comes after several sessions where the Niftycame within touching distance of achieving a record high. By 9:55 am, the Nifty 50 was trading 200.70 points higher at 18,891.90, while the S&P BSE Sensex was up 681.94 points at 63,651.94. Swapnil Shah, Director of Research, StoxBox, said, \"Nifty has crossed the previous ATH (all-time high) and moved beyond the crucial 18,900 levels for the first time in history as market sentiment remained buoyed by the progressive news about the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger and strong current account deficit data for the fourth quarter.\" \"Yesterday’s closing in the green of the US markets also supported gains in today’s trading session. We believe that a rapid and widespread progress of the monsoon, albeit with delay, should keep investors interested in the markets in the short term,\" he said. While the Sensex also hit a fresh record high today, it had already achieved the milestone twice last week. In addition, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 were also closing in on their record highs. All the sectoral indices were trading in positive territory, reflecting the positive sentiments on Dalal Street. Nifty Metal was leading the pack, with gains of over 1 per cent. The top five gainers on the Nifty 50 were Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Titan, JSW Steel and Bajaj Finance. On the other hand, the top losers were HDFC Life, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra and ONGC. The record rally in the domestic benchmark indices, including the Nifty 50, has been driven by strong domestic growth, easing inflation, strong foreign inflows, and robust corporate earnings. Analysts remain optimistic about domestic stock markets, both from an economic and technical point of view.",

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty at a lifetime high: What's behind the share markets rally?",
    "body": "Sensex, Nifty rise:Indian stock market indices surged to new highs, with the Nifty 50 reaching a record level of 19,201.70 and the S&P BSE Sensex settling at a fresh peak of 64,718.56. Due to the rally in equities, the market capitalisation (mcap) of BSE-listed companies jumped to₹295.72 lakh crore, setting a lifetime high. (Sensex, Nifty all updates) The benchmark had its strongest week in over 11 months, and advances extended for the fourth month in a row. But what is fuelling the share markets' rise? Here are some reasons: One of the major reasons for India's benchmark indices reaching new record highs is due to the boost in the performance of information technology (IT) stocks. Twelve of the 13 major sector indices logged gains, with the IT index rising over 2% each. Infosys jumped over 3%. The IT industry heavily relies on clients from the United States, so the positive release of strong economic data from the world's largest economy has eased concerns about a slowdown and improved the overall market sentiment. US' favourable economic indicators like increased first-quarter GDP, decreased jobless claims, and successful stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve have reduced economy slowdown worries, boosting the markets. The automotive sector reached new record highs, with a rise of over 2%. Auto stocks such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp, and Maruti Suzuki emerged as top gainers among the Nifty 50 companies, ahead of the release of June sales data. Strong foreign inflows, controlled inflation, and consistent growth in corporate earnings have further boosted confidence in the Indian equities market. Positive macroeconomic fundamentals have attracted inflows totalling more than $3.5 billion. This has also helped the rupee strengthen, the strongest since January, as it closed the day at 82.0375 per dollar, up from 82.0550 the previous session.",

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty touch record high but did they outshine gold in H-1CY23?",
    "body": "Nifty vs Sensex vs gold:After giving zero return in first two months of the current year (CY) 2023, key benchmark indices of theIndian stock market— NSE Nifty andBSESensex — witnessed strong rally in last four months that helped both indices to touch record high on the last session of CY2023. In first six months of CY23, Nifty has delivered 5.83 per cent return whereas 30-stock index Sensex surged to the tune of 6.32 per cent in this time. However, gold is not a laggard in terms of giving return to its long term investors. In January to June 2023 time, gold has given 5.73 per cent return to its investors. Speaking on the return given by Sensex, Nifty and gold in first six months of 2023, Anuj Gupta, Vice President — research atIIFL Securitiessaid, \"BothNiftyand Sensex ended lower in first two months due to concerns of economic slowdown in the US and other strong economies. In this period, we saw gold emerging as a haven for investors as they were relocating their money from equity and other asset class to gold and bonds. But, ease in pressure on the US economy and US Fed's interest rate pause led to trend reversal in Indian markets. However, gold remained investors' favorite till end of May 2023. However, profit booking had triggered in mid of May.\" On how gold remained in reckoning despite stock market rally in India, Sugandha Sachdeva, Executive Director & Chief Strategist at Acme Investment Advisors said, \"Even though Nifty and Sensex touched record high during last session of H1-CY23, gold has also been a strong performer in the first half of 2023, with prices up around 5.73 per cent year-to-date. Gold prices have remained buoyant amid the concerns surrounding the banking crisis in the US, hopes of an interest rate cut by the US Fed towards the end of the year, weakness in the greenback, robust central banks buying in the Q1 CY23, concerns of a slowdown in growth momentum and positive globalgold ETFflows of around $1bln till May 2023. However, prices have corrected since the second half of May amid a slew of headwinds-concerns of US debt ceiling subsiding, receding inflationary pressures, sizeable net selling by central banks’ in April, and the rebound in the dollar index from multi-month lows at the expense of gold.\" \"The major turnaround in Nifty and Sensex took place in the month of April as both DIIs and FIIs became net buyers had helped Nifty register around 4.1 per cent rise. This rise in key benchmark indices in the month of April triggered buying interest in broad markets as small-cap and mid-cap indices were the first to touch life-time highs. After the robust rebound, Nifty and Sensex extended this rally in May and June as well. Nifty logged 2.60 per cent return in the month of May while in June 2023, 50-stock index registered 3.50 per cent rise,\" said Anuj Gupta of IIFL Securities. On factors that led to trend reversal on Dalal Street, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"The Nifty 50 index and Sensex witnessed a scorching rally and surged to new all-time highs in the first half of 2023. This rally has been driven by a number of factors, including robust foreign investor flows, upbeat US economic data, receding inflationary pressures, subdued crude oil prices, steady corporate earnings, and a revival of the monsoon. FIIs have pumped around $11 billion into the Indian stock market in the past four months. Further, broad-based participation from almost all sectors has contributed to the Nifty's roaring upsurge.\" Giving credit toHDFC BankHDFC merger for the last minute push in Indian markets ahead of the end of first half of 2023, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"Markets also received a nudge from the optimism surrounding the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger. This merger would create the world's fourth-largest bank bymarket capitalization. The merger is seen as a positive sign for the Indian economy, as it would create a stronger and more efficient financial institution,\" adding, \"Furthermore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the US has also brought about exuberance in the markets. His visit is likely to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries, and as a slew of strategic deals were signed, investor sentiment improved back home.\" On which asset class may outperform others in the next half of 2023, Sugandha Sachdeva said, \"It would be difficult to assess, which asset class will outperform in the second half of the year. Ultimately, the performance of both asset classes will depend on several factors, including the global economic outlook, interest rates trajectory, and geopolitical developments.\" Disclaimer:The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

    "body": "Stock Market Today, Share Market Updates:The topline equity indices recovered theirprevious session’s lossesand ended nearly 3 per cent higher on Friday taking cues from their global peers which rose after China cut a key lending benchmark to support a slowing economy. The S&PBSE Sensexsurged 1,534.16 points (2.91 per cent) to end at 54,326.39 while theNifty 50climbed 456.75 points (2.89 per cent) to settle at 16,266.15. Both the indices had opened over 1.5 per cent higher earlier in the day and surged more as the session progressed with the Sensex touching an intraday high of 54,396.43 and the broader Nifty hitting 16,283.05. All the Sensex stocks ended higher on Friday with the top gainers being Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Reliance Industries (RIL),Nestle India,Tata Steel, Larsen & Toubro (L&T),IndusIndBank, Axis Bank, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). All the sectoral indices on the NSE ended in green on Friday. Nifty Media index rose 4.47 per cent led by gains in the shares of Sun TV Network, Network18 Media & Investments and Inox Leisure. TheNifty Realty indexclimbed 4.21 per cent aided byMacrotech Developersand ThePhoenix Mills. This apart, the keyBank Niftyended 2.88 per cent higher following a rise in share prices of AU Small Finance Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank. In the broader market, the S&P BSE MidCap index ended at 22,506.85, up 437.12 points (1.98 per cent) while the S&P BSE SmallCap settled at 26,351.29, up 550.25 points (2.13 per cent). The volatility index or India VIX on NSE declined 5.93 per cent to 23.10. Commenting on the market rally on Friday, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “The market displayed a confident yet calm rally throughout the day, supported by fortified global markets, especially the Asian market. The Chinese Central bank cut a key interest rate to support growth, injecting optimism into emerging markets. With concerns over an economic slowdown and rate hikes across the globe, investors will continue to invest with caution. Value stocks should do well during this consolidation period.” Shares rebounded on Friday after China cut a key lending benchmark to support its economy, though a global equities gauge remained set for its longest weekly losing streak on record amid investor worries about slowing growth and highinflation. At 0833 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 1.2 per cent and set for its first daily gain in three. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, rose 0.5 per cent but for the week was still shedding 1 per cent and on track for its seventh consecutive weekly decline, its longest losing streak since its inception in 2001. The gains in Europe and Asia came after a late Thursday rally on Wall Street petered out, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.75 per cent, the S&P 500 0.58 per cent lower and the Nasdaq Composite off by 0.26 per cent. -global market input from Reuters Nine young men from the Dimasa tribe, working at a construction site in Tamil Nadu, were killed when a concrete arch they were working on collapsed.

    "body": "Boom to gloom: India middle-class jitters amid trillion-dollar market rout 6 March 2025 Share Save Soutik Biswas and Nikhil Inamdar BBC News Share Save BBC Rajesh Kumar pulled out the bulk of his bank savings and and shifted to the stock market Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds. With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five. But the tide has turned. For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge. India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third. \"For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,\" Mr Kumar says. Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; £16,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. \"Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,\" he says. His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution. The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media \"finfluencers\" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike. Tarun Sircar moved his retirement fund to the stock market last year before the crash Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor. When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market. \"I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!\" For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. \"I'm both ignorant and confident,\" he says with wry candour. \"Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype.\" Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. \"The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,\" he says. In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. \"When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed.\" Mr Sircar lives in hope. \"My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green.\" Reuters One in five Indian households have put their savings in the stock market There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic. Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market. \"I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,\" he says. Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in . \"This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,\" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. \"Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next.\" Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets. On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. \"The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,\" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. \"Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?\" Getty Images Monika Halan says new investors must learn to manage expectations This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses. \"In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,\" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst. \"Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances.\" Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. \"We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event.\" But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs. Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite. Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious. In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors. \"This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,\" says Ms Halan. \"If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.\" Follow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube, X and Facebook . Asia Stock markets Middle classes India",

The rout comes after the blue-chip indexes surged to record highs on Monday as exit polls had projected a much bigger margin of victory . Reuters Graphics While the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will still likely form the government, analysts said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning fewer seats could prevent the government from pursuing an aggressive reform agenda. The Nifty and the Sensex plunged as much as 8.5% earlier, before recouping some losses to end at 21,884.5 points and 72,079.05 points, respectively.

    "body": "India stocks see biggest fall for over four years 4 June 2024 Share Save Share Save Getty Images Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have to rely more on allies in forming a government Indian stocks have fallen sharply after vote counting in the country's general election indicated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party might not be able to form a majority government. The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 share index closed down nearly 6%, its steepest fall since India's first Covid lockdowns in March 2020. Early results suggest Mr Modi's political party may need to rely on allies and form a coalition government. That could lead to uncertainty over economic policies, some analysts said. The NSE Nifty 50, which comprises stocks in various big companies, had plunged 8.5% at one point but ended the day down 5.9% at 21,884.5 points. The S&P BSE Sensex also fell sharply, closing 5.7% lower at 72,079.05. The rupee slid 0.5% against the US dollar, its biggest fall in 16 months. More than half the votes have been counted in India's general election, and Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks unlikely to secure a majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament. It may have to rely on allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to form the next government. Analysts suggest that could lead to some uncertainty over economic policies, such as a push for investment, which has been one of the mainstays of the Modi government's rule. \"The key question is whether BJP can retain single-party majority,\" Ken Peng, head of investment strategy, Asia, at Citi Global Wealth, told Reuters. \"If not, then would its coalition be able to deliver economic development, particularly infrastructure?\" Puneet Sharma, chief executive and fund manager at Whitespace Alpha, told Reuters that if the new government is dependent on coalition partners it \"may shift its focus\" to put more emphasis on welfare \"rather than concentrating on reforms during the July budget\". The Hindu nationalist BJP won majorities in 2014 and 2019. Markets had soared on Monday after exit polls over the weekend had suggested Mr Modi and the BJP would gain a significant victory. But it now looks as though the BJP will fall short of achieving a majority by itself. Market analyst Fiona Cincotta told the BBC key Indian stock indexes had been \"really battered\". She added that there had been some \"very big fallers\" in individual stocks, including oil and gas firm Reliance Industries, and Bank of India. Stock markets",

What foreign investors say India's government bonds are expected to remain attractive to foreign investors, despite concerns over potential policy shifts following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's narrower-than-expected victory margin in the recent elections. Although the unexpected election outcome caused a dip in stocks, bonds, and the rupee due to fears of increased populist spending and a slowdown in reforms, fund managers remain optimistic about the bond market.Kenneth Akintewe, head of Asian sovereign debt at abrdn, views the initial response of higher yields and currency weakness as \"an attractive opportunity to add risk.\" He believes that the positive outlook for bonds remains largely unaffected by the election results, particularly given the stronger-than-expected fiscal starting point.Adarsh Sinha, co-head of Asia FX & rates strategy at Bank of America, questions the likelihood of a surge in populist spending immediately after the elections. \"For the government, what would be the incentive to splurge after the election in the near term?\" Sinha suggests that expectations of such spending may be misplaced. (Reuters) The medium-term growth story in India does not change, as strong cycles that have begun are likely to support themselves. The extent and duration of the cycle will become clearer once the new government is sworn in as we look at the 100-day agenda. We retain our modest market returns view for this year with the year-end (Dec 24) target set at 23,500 (remains unchanged).

He says that long-term investors should maintain their belief in India's solid economic fundamentals and expect the market benchmarks to double in the next 5-6 years. The narrative around ‘Make in India’ is not expected to change but the dynamics may be different as the new reality of the NDA coalition government plays out. However, the pace of execution in policies may slow down a bit so the expectations from infrastructure and manufacturing stocks may be toned down. Stock Market Today Live Updates: BSE Sensex Stocks At 1:03 PM Stock Market Today Live Updates: Short-term volatility likely Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities, anticipates that the markets will continue to experience short-term volatility, despite the historic third consecutive victory of the NDA-led BJP government. Given the current circumstances, it is recommended that investors and traders exercise caution and allow the markets to find stability following the unexpected election results. Defensive sectors such as FMCG, Telecom, and Pharma, which are less influenced by government policies, may be a prudent focus for market participants, says Tapse.The upcoming budget presentation and the release of quarterly earnings reports are expected to be significant events that could impact market trends. There is concern regarding the potential repositioning of FIIs and the resilience of DII investments in the near term. From a technical perspective, the market's upside potential appears limited in the short term, while the downside may unfold gradually. The crucial level to monitor is the 21,000 mark; a close below this psychological threshold could trigger further selling pressure, potentially pushing the market down to test the 20,200 level, he was quoted as saying by ET.

Stock Market Today Live Updates: How New Government Will Face Key Policy Issues Geopolitical uncertainties and the global economic situation may require acceleration of reforms. But with a coalition govt at the Centre, it may not be easy as some issues, such as privatisation and a relook at GST, need consensus. TOI lists top areas of focus:GST revamp: Five-slab GST rate structure may not be reviewed immediately as it may require merging the 12% and 18% slabs, necessitating an increase in levies on goods and services that move into the higher bracket. That's an issue on which political consensus may not be easy.Public Finances: Privatisation is likely to be put on a back-burner for some time. While RBI's mega dividend of Rs 2.1L crore and robust GST revenues will keep Centre's finances in good shape, the Centre may have to go slow on cleaning up the subsidy regime further, although greater use of technology to plug leakages is something that won't change.Investment push: After hitting a high of $85 billion in 2021-22, the annual inflow of foreign direct investments has fallen for two consecutive years, touching $71 billion in 2023-24. Govt is expected to make the investment regime more attractive in several sectors, including electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.Food prices: Although overall inflation has moderated (see chart below), food prices remain both volatile and high. Govt may take steps to weatherproof prices and shield it from climate-induced shocks such as heatwaves and floods.Agriculture: The latest GDP data indicates a relative stagnation in the farm sector. Reforms focusing on irrigation and use of Al to raise productivity are expected. Election results point to the challenging but imminent need to raise farmers' income.Exports & PLI: The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has helped push exports of smartphones and other products but there have been demands to extend it to more sectors, such as toys and footwear. Expect fine-tuning of PLI to focus more sharply on companies and sectors willing to shift out of China for export production.Regulatory clarity: Before the poll dates were announced, several new economic legislations were in the works. A better regulation of cryptocurrencies, Al, data protection is under consideration.Maintaining growth: Most economists do not expect 2024-25 GDP growth to be a repeat of 8.2% growth in 2023-24. But ensuring a growth rate of even 7% in the current global economic environment won't be easy. Among the steps expected are a road map for energy transition and a push for infra investments. Economic ministries have made action plans with specific targets for 2030 and 2047. A ministry-wise action plan could be unveiled, if there is a consensus in the new govt.

Stock Market Today Live Updates: How PSU stocks reacted on June 4 Stock market crash: The stock market experienced a significant downturn on Tuesday, with public sector enterprises (PSUs) bearing the brunt of the losses. Investors expressed concerns about the future prospects of these companies following the Bharatiya Janata Party's failure to secure a decisive majority in the general elections. The market had anticipated that a strong BJP-led government would be crucial for further gains in PSU stocks. However, the election outcome has raised doubts about the government's ability to effectively revive state-owned companies during its third term.The BSE's PSU index suffered its worst single-day losses, plummeting by 15.7%. Several PSU stocks were hit particularly hard, with Power financier REC leading the pack with a 24% slump. Other notable losers included Power Finance Corporation, Container Corporation of India, Bharat Electronics, BHEL, and SAIL, all of which saw their stock prices drop between 18-22%. The majority of PSU stocks experienced declines exceeding 10% during the trading session. The market capitalisation of PSUs collectively lost ₹10.62 lakh crore in a single day.Vinit Sambre, Head Equities at DSP Mutual Fund, commented on the market reaction, saying, \"Over the last 18 months, the valuation gap between the PSU and their private counterparts had been narrowing as a result of massive rerating fuelled by optimism surrounding the BJP's development agenda. However, the unexpected election result has affected this narrative, leading to a swift unwinding of the positive sentiment that had been built up.\" Stock Market Today Live Updates: Pace of reforms to not slow down? Morgan Stanley's Riddham Desai has shared his insights on the recent election verdict and its potential impact on the Indian equity markets. According to Desai, the firm's medium to long-term views remain unchanged despite the outcome of the elections.He expects both realized and implied volatility to decrease in the coming days, suggesting a more stable market environment. However, Desai points out that the equity markets have not yet priced in the possibility of \"unresolvable disagreements within the NDA coalition,\" which could potentially lead to some uncertainty.Despite this, Desai believes that the pace of reforms is unlikely to slow down following the election results. He also expresses confidence that the government will continue to prioritize macro stability as the foundation of its economic policy, rather than sacrificing it for short-term gains. Stock Market Today Live Updates: ‘Markets will take time to recover’ According to Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, the unexpected election outcomes will require some time for the market to digest. Although stability is expected to be restored in the near future, fluctuations will persist until there is transparency regarding the cabinet and crucial portfolios. In the short term, a significant market recovery is improbable, but sector-specific preferences may shift. Industries such as FMCG, healthcare, and IT will gain increasing favor, while momentum plays will decelerate, he said.The sharp market correction has one advantage: it has slightly reduced the excessive valuations, which will encourage institutional buying once the cabinet's formation and composition are clarified.Investors can begin accumulating high-quality largecaps in sectors such as IT, financials, autos, and capital goods, he says. Stock Market Today Live Updates: Sensex, Nifty pare initial gains Stock market today: After rising over 650 points, Indian markets pared initial gains on Wednesday. At 9:49 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 72,142.00, up 63 points or 0.087%. Nifty50 was at 21,906.35, down 22 points or 0.100%. Sectors (PSUs and nonPSUs) that previously enjoyed inflated valuations due to expectations of strong reform-driven growth may experience some downward pressure on valuations Stock Market Today Live Updates: What’s the road ahead for investors? Mahesh Nandurkar from Jefferies shares his insights on the potential outcome of the elections and its impact on various sectors. He maintains that the most likely scenario is a coalition government with Narendra Modi at the helm.Despite the uncertainty surrounding the elections, Nandurkar remains optimistic about the housing-led capital expenditure cycle. He believes that any extreme market reactions to the election results could present a lucrative buying opportunity for investors, according to an ET report.According to Nandurkar, large-cap stocks that have underperformed in the recent past offer the most attractive risk-reward ratio. He particularly favors private banks, consumer staples, and automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). However, he has reduced his overweight stance on real estate, industrials, and public sector undertakings (PSUs).

Stock Market Today Live Updates: Check out the stocks in news today Stock market crash: The domestic markets experienced a significant intraday decline yesterday, the largest in over four years, as the election results indicated the NDA's return to power but with a reduced majority. Today's trading session will focus on various companies, including Tata Motors, Wipro, RIL, SJVN, NTPC, and Canara Bank, due to recent developments.SJVNanticipates its 900 MW Arun-3 hydro-electric project in Nepal, currently under construction, to commence power generation from the following year, as approximately 75% of the work has been completed.PSU stockswill remain in the spotlight today following a significant sell-off on Monday, which was triggered by the NDA securing a lower-than-expected majority in the Lok Sabha elections.Tata Motors' board has given the green light to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary, proposed to be named TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCVL), to manage its commercial vehicles business.RIL, a major constituent of the Nifty50 index, will be closely watched today after the company's investors lost around Rs 1.27 lakh crore on Tuesday.Wiprohas partnered with Zscaler to introduce \"Wipro Cyber X-Ray,\" an AI-assisted decision support platform.Infosyshas announced a collaboration with Nihon Chouzai (TSE) to expand healthcare access in Japan by enhancing online medication guidance services.NTPCis reportedly planning to venture into the nuclear power sector by establishing a 10 GW capacity with an investment of Rs 1.5 lakh crore over a 10-year period.Canara Bankhas reportedly initiated the process of seeking regulatory approval to convert its software services subsidiary into a non-banking finance company. We are of the view that the current market texture is extremely volatile and uncertain; hence, it is advisable that traders should remain cautious for next few trading sessions Stock Market Today Live Updates: What should investors do? Stock Market Today Live Updates: What’s happening in global markets? On Tuesday, U.S. stocks experienced a modest increase following the publication of weaker-than-expected labor market data. This information strengthened the notion that the Federal Reserve may soon lower interest rates. The data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. job openings in April fell to the lowest level in more than three years, suggesting a softening of labor market conditions. This development is consistent with the anticipated Fed rate cut in the near term. As a result, U.S. Treasury yields declined after the report's release.In early Asian trading on Wednesday, oil prices continued to slide slightly from the previous session after an industry report indicated increases in U.S. crude and fuel stockpiles. This news further exacerbated concerns regarding demand growth. Brent crude futures fell 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $77.38 a barrel by 0005 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 18 cents, or 0.3%, to $73.07 a barrel. Stock Market Today Live Updates: What GIFT Nifty signals Gift Nifty (formerly SGX Nifty) indicates a positive openingNifty futures on the Gift Nifty rose by 103 points, or 0.47%, to trade at 22,050 The markets are pricing the risk associated with this scenario, and the potential impact of a shift toward socialist policies by the government, thus leading to a sell-off, We would like to see the incoming govt continue to create a favourable environment for four growth factors: increased foreign direct investments into the country, private capex, continuation of govt capex and better infrastructure, both social and physical Stock Market Today Live Updates: Budget to be keenly watched Investment professionals hold the view that capital expenditure, undertaken by both the government and private enterprises, plays a crucial role in driving economic growth. They emphasize the importance of private sector investment, which has been significantly lacking in recent years, and stress that it should either supplement or complement the government's capital expenditure efforts.Given India's favorable macroeconomic fundamentals, fund managers believe that any positive developments on the global stage could provide additional support to the domestic economy. These potential tailwinds include improving macroeconomic conditions in China and interest rate reductions in the United States.The upcoming Budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025 is expected to be a key determinant of the future trajectory of the Indian economy and financial markets. Market participants will closely monitor the budget announcements and their potential impact on various sectors and overall economic growth prospects. Stock Market Today Live Updates: Development agenda to continue? Stock market crash: According to Vinit Sambre, head (equities), DSP Mutual Fund, “There is a bit of uncertainty as investors are concerned about the slowdown of reforms that had been initiated under the (outgoing) BJP-led govt. This has triggered a correction in the markets as investors reassess the outlook under the new political landscape. We would like to believe that the development agenda that spurred the performance of equity is likely to persist, irrespective of the party in power.” The election result is likely to lead to a more balanced market. Risk-reward in large-caps and underperforming sectors like banking and consumer appear more favourable. There is likely to be greater scrutiny and valuation discipline in the performing sectors like capital goods, power, defence and manufacturing Stock Market Today Live Updates: Raging bull market to be reined in? Stock market live updates: Fund managers in India are hopeful that the new government will maintain the current momentum of economic reforms and policies that support the industry. They anticipate that the BJP-led alliance, despite having a reduced mandate, will persist with the initiatives and projects initiated by the previous government. This sentiment prevails even amidst the apprehension that gripped investors following the announcement of the Lok Sabha election results on Tuesday.Furthermore, financial experts believe that the election outcome, which is seen as a setback for the ruling alliance but a significant boost for the opposition, has the potential to temper the surging bull market in India and bring valuations to a more reasonable level. Most believe that even though the BJP-led alliance now has a depleted mandate, it would continue the works and projects launched under the outgoing govt. Stock Market Today Live Updates: Adani stocks take a severe beating Stock market crash: The stock prices of all 11 Adani Group companies plummeted on Tuesday, resulting in a staggering loss of Rs 3.6 lakh crore for investors. The crash was attributed to the reduced mandate for the BJP-led NDA coalition. Since Prime Minister Modi took office in May 2014, opposition parties have claimed that the Adani Group has gained the most. Investors speculate that a weakened NDA mandate could cause the group to lose its competitive edge. Additionally, the group would face increased scrutiny from a more powerful opposition.According to dealers, these factors contributed to the decline of Adani Group stocks in Tuesday's crashing market. BSE data revealed that the group's combined market capitalization dropped from Rs 19.4 lakh crore on Monday to Rs 15.8 lakh crore as stock prices of Adani Group companies plunged during the day.The group's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, led the decline with a 19% crash, eroding its market cap by Rs 80,416 crore. Adani Ports, which will soon join the sensex, lost nearly Rs 72,800 crore, or a fifth of its market value, bringing its current level to Rs 2.7 lakh crore. Other group companies also suffered significant losses, with Adani Green Energy losing nearly Rs 62,000 crore and Adani Power losing about Rs 58,300 crore in market value. Stock Market Today Live Updates: What happens to IPO launches? India has secured the second position in the global IPO market, raising $4 billion in the current year. With the NDA expected to form the next government, the IPO boom is likely to continue throughout 2024 due to anticipated policy stability. Although the amount raised by India is 45% lower than the total collected in 2023, according to LSEG data, it surpasses China ($3 billion) and Saudi Arabia ($2.1 billion). India's IPO proceeds also exceed the combined amount raised in Turkey, Hong Kong, and South Korea. The US remains the top IPO market, having raised $14 billion so far in 2024, as per LSEG. India has climbed from the 11th position in 2019 to the third place globally in terms of IPO proceeds, following the US and China in 2023.Between January and the present, India has witnessed 113 IPOs. Mahavir Lunawat, MD at investment bank Pantomath Capital Advisors, said, \"Amidst general elections, the primary market remained vibrant with the solid response to certain IPOs like Awfis Space Solutions. Confidence can be gauged by these offerings that have been launched amidst elections... Looking ahead, the market is set to witness a flurry of IPOs, from new-age business as well as from conventional business segments.\"Several prominent companies, including Hyundai Motor India, Tata Capital, Ola Electric Mobility, Swiggy, and NSDL, are planning to launch their IPOs in the near future. Stock Market Today Live Updates: ‘Investors to focus on government formation’ According to UBS, “After a weak political outcome, we believe investors will focus on govt formation and the choice of prime ministerial candidate considering the BJP does not have a simple majority of its own.” The other focus areas would be “policy choices to support growth vis-a-vis ensuring macro stability, and the reform narrative”.UBS analysts said they would watch out for upcoming union budget announcements, implementation of labour laws and the next set of reforms in land and capital.“This was not an election outcome the market valuations were set up for. Indian valuations have been expensive for pretty ordinary corporate earnings growth/outlook. One of the arguments behind India’s rich valuations has been the political stability/policy certainty afforded by a strong govt. Some of those assumptions could now come under question,” the report by UBS said. Stock Market Today Live Updates: What will be the market reaction - immediate and long-term? Stock market live updates: According to Pradeep Gupta, Co-founder & Vice-chairman, Anand Rathi Group, the Indian stock markets experienced significant volatility in response to the 2024 Lok Sabha election results with broader indices, Nifty 50 closing the day at -5.93%, with the lowest of the day touching -8.19%. Here are the key reactions and insights based on recent market movements and expert analyses by Anand Rathi.•Immediate Market Reaction:The markets saw heightened volatility due to the uncertainty surrounding the election outcomes mainly due to the gap between the exit polls and the actual results declared today. The pre-election rally witnessed yesterday, driven by expectations of a BJP victory, had already been factored into market prices. Till the question of the continuity of the current government was at an unsure position, the markets continued with heightened volatility in the short term period.•Long-Term Outlook:Historical data suggests that despite initial volatility, markets tend to recover and even thrive in the longer term. For instance, even after the 2014 and 2019 elections, the Indian stock market saw significant gains in the months following the election results. Investors are advised to focus on long-term strategies, such as maintaining a diversified portfolio and avoiding panic selling. Strong fundamentals and resilience against political changes are crucial for navigating market volatility.•Sectoral Impact:Sectors like infrastructure, defence, and capital goods are expected to benefit from policy continuity and government focus on development projects.Large-cap stocks are preferred for their stability and resilience against economic fluctuations. In summary, while the immediate market reaction to the election results has been volatile, the overall long-term outlook remains positive, particularly if policy continuity is maintained. Investors are encouraged to stay informed, focus on fundamentals, and be prepared for short-term fluctuations. NITISH AND NAIDU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFULL AND SHOULD NOT ALIGN WITH INDI GROUP AS THEY HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCES IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE O... Sensex will cross 100000 very soon.. The trends yesterday panicked the investors but now they have the solace that BJP will form the alliance government and Ada-Amba will continue to flou...",

    "title": "Nifty 50 outlook: 4 key reasons why Indian stock market may fall 5-10%; Emkay lists 5 stocks to avoid",
    "body": "Nifty 50 outlook: Indian stock market benchmarks may see a significant correction of 5-10 per cent in the near term, while the mid and small-cap segments may suffer more. However, the long-term prospects of the Indian stock market remain positive and a meaningful correction could be an opportunity to buy stocks, according to brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services. \"We see the risk of an imminent 5-10 per cent correction in the headline indices, with bigger drawdowns inSMID(small and midcap) stocks. We remain constructive on India from a longer-term (more than 1one year) perspective and would use a meaningful correction to increase exposure to the market,\" said Emkay. The brokerage firm pointed out that the market'svaluationis stretched, and most variables are already priced. The Q1FY25 earnings are expected to remain tepid, and rate cuts in the US may start only at the end of the year. After a 1.1 per cent fall in the previous session, market benchmark Nifty 50 opened 0.3 per cent lower at 24,445.75 on Monday, July 22, and slipped further by 0.7 per cent to a level of 24,362.30. However, the index reversed losses and moved up soon, thanks to support from select heavyweights such asHDFC BankandInfosys. Around 11 am, the index traded 0.2 per cent up at 24,575. Emkay Global highlighted the following four key reasons why the Indian stock market could see a correction: Emkay expects policy continuity in the Budget. It said fiscal deficit should be maintained at about 5-5.1 per cent of GDP, with a focus on capital expenditure (capex) over revenue expenditure (revex). \"We see little risk of a pivot to increased welfare spending, despite the pressures of a relatively adverse election result and the loss of absolute majority for the BJP. The₹2.1 lakh crore windfall from the RBI dividend gives the government increased degrees of freedom on both, pursuing fiscal prudence and pushing capex,\" said Emkay. \"We would, however, watch for forward movement on privatization (unlikely) and asset monetisation (more likely). There is an outlier probability of negative changes in the capital gains regime, which could trigger a strong sell-off and prolonged sideways market after that,\" Emkay said. The brokerage firm emphasized that the market seems complacent about the changed political landscape, posing a risk if the upcoming assembly elections yield unexpected results. \"Though the government remains stable, there could be adverse events (like a possible NDA defeat in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections) that could exacerbate uncertainty,\" said Emkay. Emkay observed that the growth in FY24 PAT (profit after tax) was led by a 275bps improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins (BSE-500, excluding financials). This is now in the base. \"For financials, upward normalisation of credit costs could dampen PAT growth. This is partly reflected in the FY25 Nifty EPS (earning per share) growth slowing to 16.5 per cent (FY24: 18.2 per cent). While the forecasts have little downside risk, upgrade potential also looks dim,\" said Emkay. \"A weak Q1 owing to stretched valuations and a strong lead-up stock-price rally could trigger a correction. The manufacturing sector, overall, is a little more exposed to this risk than the services sector. Tech would be most immune from this trend,\" said Emkay. Emkay expects the tight monetary conditions to persist till end-2024. \"Our base case is that the Fed starts cutting rates in Q4CY25, with significant risks of further delay. The RBI is likely to be in lockstep (by choice if not by necessity), with little chance of a rate cut until inflation is firmly in the comfort zone of nearly 4 per cent,\" said Emkay. \"Domestic liquidity conditions have eased somewhat, but we expect active RBI interventions to ensure no rate cut by stealth. Therefore, the rally in banks could fizzle out as expectations of easier monetary conditions ease. For investors wishing to position themselves ahead of the year-end rate cuts, the best sectors would be autos, real estate, and technology – this, however, could take more than six months to fructify,\" Emkay said. Emkay underscored that the post-election rally has shot up the valuations of the Indian stock market. \"The Nifty, at 21.4 times one-year forward PE, is 10 per cent above the five-year historic mean. Valuations for the NSE Midcap 150 (42 times trailing PE) and NSE smallcap 250 (31 times trailing PE) are also 52.5 per cent and 35.5 per cent, respectively, above the five-year averages. Even accounting for the strong growth outlook, we see these valuations having some front-ended future returns and setting up the market for a one-time correction,\" said Emkay. \"Only meaningful upgrades in forward estimates could support such elevated multiples, and we do not see that in the next one to two quarters,\" Emkay said. HDFC Bank, SBI Cards, PI Industries, Eicher Motors and L&T Technology Services are the stocks in the \"key avoids\" list of the brokerage firm. Emkay is underweight on financials and said even as the market adjusts to new growth or ROE (return on equity) reality, there is scope for derating in HDFC Bank and SBI Cards \"We initiate a key avoids list. Our underweight financials are reflected via HDFC Bank and SBI Cards, as we see derating in both stocks even as the market adjusts to a new growth/ROE reality,\" said Emkay. The brokerage firm has added Eicher to the list as it prefers Hero and TVS, given product positioning and valuations. Emaky said L&T Technology Services, at 40 times PE, is at an unwarranted premium to large-cap IT services names, especially with a looming weak FY25 (5 per cent EPS grwoth). PI Industries is the fifth stock: the sub-5 per cent EPS growth for FY25 and FY26 is not yet reflected in the 33 times PE ratio. Emkay's model portfolio includes TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp, Dabur, HUL, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, UltraTech Cement and IndiGo among the top stocks to buy. Suprajit Engineering, Honasa Consumer and Senco Gold are among Emkay's top recommendations from the small and midcap segments.

Asia continues to drive growth in the global futures and options industry, with Asian trading volumes breaking 40 billion lots in a single quarter for the first time. FOW Data shows Asian exchanges traded 40.7 billion contracts in the three months to the end of June, which was up 106% from the second quarter of last year and 4% higher than the first three months of 2024. June was the second busiest month on record for Asian futures and options exchanges, reporting 13.96 billion lots, which was up 99% on June 2023 and down 6% on May’s record of 14.857 billion contracts traded, FOW Data shows. Chart One: ASIAN FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING VOLUME The main drivers of growth in Asia are a handful of Indian equity index options contracts, listed on Mumbai’s National Stock Exchange of India and Bombay Stock Exchange, which currently host the six most-traded listed derivatives globally. The top contract in Asia and globally last month was the National Stock Exchange of India’s Nifty Bank index option which traded in June 4.208 billion contracts, which was up 65.6% on the same month in 2023, according to FOW Data. The NSE bank index option traded 12.071 billion lots in the second quarter, which represented an increase of two-thirds on the same quarter last year and a decline of 15.6% on the previous quarter, an all-time record for the Indian contract. The contract had open interest of 6.56 million lots at the end of June. The NSE Nifty Bank index option took in June top spot from NSE’s other main index option contract, the Nifty 50 index option. The Nifty 50 index option on the Indian blue-chip standard traded 4.112 billion lots last month, according to FOW Data, which was up 138.7% on June 2023, albeit down slightly from the trading record for the product in May. In the second quarter, the options contract was up 45.5% on the previous three months. This rapid increase was the main driver for the increase in overall Asia volumes in Q2. The open interest on the NSE Nifty 50 option was 10.35 million lots at the end of last month, according to FOW Data. Chart Two: NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA’S NIFTY BANK AND NIFTY 50 OPTIONS The two largest Indian index options contracts jointly contributed an extra 4 billion lots to the Asia June volumes compared to June 2023 and an additional 11.5 billion lots to the second quarter totals versus the same period last year. Another key factor in the Asian quarterly volume record has been the success of Bombay Stock Exchange’s S&P BSE Sensex equity index option, which references the oldest Indian index, made up of 30 of the largest and most liquid Indian blue-chips listed on the BSE. The S&P BSE Sensex equity option, which has emerged as the world’s third most popular listed derivative just over a year after launching in May 2023, reported 1.971 billion lots traded last month, which was more than 58 times the total in June last year but 14.2% below the previous month’s record of 2.297 billion lots. The BSE equity index option traded 5.853 billion lots last quarter, according to FOW Data, which was more than 175 times the volume in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the two larger NSE equity options contract, the BSE S&P Sensex equity options’ relatively low open interest of 42,650 lots suggests retail traders make up the vast majority of the activity in this market The fourth most-traded contact in Asia (and the world) is the National Stock Exchange of India’s Nifty Financial Services equity index option, which traded 1.264 billion lots in June, up 8.5% on the same month last year and 0.8% on the preceding month. The fifth most popular listed derivative is the S&P Bankex equity option on the BSE, which traded 617.4 million lots last month after launching in May last year, and sixth on the list is the NSE Nifty Midcap Select equity index option. The remainder of the global top ten list comprises three Brazilian futures traded on B3 and CME’s three month SOFR futures contract. Rutesh Durve, director of Business Development and Relationship Management at Nuvama Asset Services, told a FOW conference in April that, while India is perceived as complicated and difficult to access, there are different routes to market such as trading through an onshore broker or an international firm that has a presence in India. Durve said: “At some point, India becomes large enough that you need someone onshore.” FOW will host on September 19 2024 the fourth edition of its flagship Indian conference in Mumbai.

    "body": "July 19, 2024·15:39 IST July 19, 2024·15:54 IST Avdhut Bagkar Technical and Derivatives Analyst, StoxBox Indian shares traded lower on Friday due to weak global market cues and fears of new U.S.-China trade tensions. Despite opening at record highs, the Nifty 50 and Sensex quickly slipped into the red and fell sharply later in the session. India's benchmark stock indices ended their rally by hitting downward trends after a fresh record high for the fourth consecutive session on Friday. Sectors like Metal, Auto, Financial Services, and Energy saw significant declines. Brokerages' Stocks Fall As Microsoft Outage Impacts Operation. On the stock-specific front, Infosys shares rose after posting better-than-expected Q1 FY25 results and raising its FY25 revenue growth forecast to 3-4%. Other top gainers included Asian Paints, LTIMindtree, and Titan Company. In contrast, Persistent Systems fell nearly 7% after its Q1 profit missed estimates. The benchmark index initially opened 52 points higher but quickly faced selling pressure. After reaching a peak of 24854, it dropped over 100 points in the first few minutes of trading, accompanied by high volume, setting the tone for the day. The index continued to trend lower as selling pressure intensified, closing 269 points lower. Despite a significant correction and adverse market and momentum breadth, the index showed resilience by not dropping below the prior day’s low and closing above the psychological mark of 24500. Going forward, it will be crucial for the index to maintain support in the range of 24500-24200 to sustain bullish momentum. July 19, 2024·15:49 IST Riya Singh – Research Analyst, Commodities and Currency , Emkay Global Gold and silver prices experienced a sharp decline following the sentiment that the anticipated bullish phase might have occurred earlier than expected, leading to profit-taking. A recent slowdown in seasonal demand could exert downward pressure on prices if ETF flows do not persist or if tactical investors retreat due to high prices. U.S. data revealed the largest increase in initial jobless claims since early May, indicating a cooling labor market. This development supports a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Despite the recent dip, gold remains nearly 20% higher, and silver over 15% higher since the beginning of the year. Additionally, uncertainty in the U.S. political landscape is contributing to short-term volatility. This temporary decline is seen as a necessary adjustment, providing central bankers an opportunity to regain purchase traction. For Gold support is placed at $2385 - $2350 whereas for silver it is at $29. - $28.85 On the other hand, oil prices have continued to decline, influenced by weak demand from China and pressure from a stronger dollar. China's economy grew at a much slower pace than expected in the second quarter, countering the narrative of tight supply. However, the significant drawdown in U.S. stockpiles and improved compliance with production cuts by OPEC members are expected to keep the market undersupplied by more than a million barrels, thereby providing support for crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices are expected to find support around $78 to $80 per barrel. Meanwhile, the USD/INR is trading at an all-time low due to a stronger dollar and widespread weakness across Asian currencies. According to the latest bulletin released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank purchased $4.2 billion of forex. Additionally, the market is closely monitoring the Union budget for FY 2024-25, to be held on July 23rd, for a clearer picture of economic growth. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised India's growth projection from 6.8% to 7%. The rupee is expected to respect the resistance of 83.75 – 83.85 levels, with a potential retracement to the 83.50 level.

    "title": "Sensex, Nifty 50 end lower— 10 key highlights from Indian stock market today",
    "body": "Indian stock market ended slightly lower on Friday, May 30, tracking mixed global cues. The Sensex closed 182 points, or 0.22 per cent, lower at 81,451.01, while the Nifty 50 settled 24,750.70, 83 points, or 0.33 per cent, down on the first day of the June futures and options (F&O) series. Thus, the key indices extended losses to the second consecutive week. The mid and small-cap segments ended mixed. The BSE Midcap index fell 0.39 per cent, while theSmallcapindex rose 0.17 per cent. The Nifty extended the gains to the third consecutive month, rising nearly 2 per cent in May. However, the index has been consolidating in the recent past due to stretched valuations and the lack of fresh positive triggers. \"Participants are now awaiting a fresh trigger to break the consolidation and resume the broader trend. In the meantime, one should align their trades with sectoral trends and themes that are attracting noticeable interest,\" said Ajit Mishra, SVP of research at Religare Broking. \"We recommend maintaining a 'buy on dips' approach, unless the Nifty decisively breaks below its first line of defence—the 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), currently around the 24,600 level. A breach of this level could increase pressure and extend the current consolidation phase,\" said Mishra. Investors remain cautious amid a lack of fresh triggers and due to the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs. A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily allowed US President Donald Trump to proceed with his tariffs, a day after a US trade court had blocked them. Meanwhile, reports suggest India and the US are aiming to close a trade deal by the last week of June. However, the shape of the deal is still unclear. \"A rangebound movement continued in the market, with the temporary reinstatement of US tariffs by the appeal court influencing investors to stay sidelined,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. \"The global market may contend with macroeconomic concerns as the global trade landscape has yet to see stability, which may navigate a short-term consolidation,\" Nair said. India's Q4 GDP prints are due today, which could influence market sentiment. Next week, the RBI MPC will announce its policy decision. Moreover, the progress of monsoon will also be on the radar of the market. Only seven stocks managed to end higher in the Nifty 50 index. Shares of Eternal (up 4.98 per cent), SBI (up 2.09 per cent) andHDFC Bank(up 0.73 per cent) ended as the top gainers. Bajaj Auto (down 3.10 per cent),Hindalco Industries(down 2.51 per cent) and HCL Technologies (down 2 per cent) closed as the top losers in the index. Most sectoral indices ended with losses. However, the Nifty PSU Bank index soared 2.88 per cent, ending as the top gainer among them. Nifty Bank rose 0.37 per cent, while the Financial Services inched up 0.08 per cent. Nifty Metal dropped 1.69 per cent, while the IT index declined 1.15 per cent. Nifty Auto fell by a per cent. Vodafone Idea(70.12 crore shares), Suzlon (54.76 crore shares), andReliance Power(53.4 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Reliance Power, Rallis India,Lords Chloro Alkali,Manugraph IndiaandAro Granite Industries, were among the 17 stocks that jumped over 10 per cent on the NSE. Innovana Thinklabs,Kiri Industries, SKM Egg Products Export (India), Prakash Pipes, Signpost India and Welspun Living were the six stocks that plunged more than 10 per cent on the NSE.

    "body": "Indian stock market benchmarks- the Sensex and the Nifty 50- ended lower on Tuesday, June 17, on profit booking in select heavyweights, includingHDFC Bank, Reliance Industries andBajaj Financeamid weak global cues. The Sensex ended the day with a loss of 213 points, or 0.26 per cent, at 81,583.30, while the Nifty 50 closed at 24,853.40, down 93 points, or 0.37 per cent. Mid-caps and small-caps segments underperformed. The BSE Midcap index fell 0.56 per cent and theSmallcapindex declined 0.67 per cent. The overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to nearly₹448 lakh crore from nearly₹450.5 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors poorer by over₹2.5 lakh crore in a single session. The domestic market ended in negative territory amid heightened concerns over tensions between Israel and Iran. Investors also restricted their bets ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision on June 18. \"The benchmark equity index experienced moderate losses amid rising risk of an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East ahead of the FOMC meeting. This uncertainty pushed Brent crude prices higher—an unfavourable development for India, given its heavy reliance on oil imports, thereby dampening earnings growth,\" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, observed. Only 11 stocks managed to end in the green in the Nifty 50 index, among which Tech Mahindra (up 1.66 per cent), Infosys (up 0.87 per cent) and Asian Paints (up 0.86 per cent) ended as the top gainers. One stock- Wipro- ended flat. Shares ofAdani Enterprises(down 2.31 per cent), Eternal (down 2.06 per cent) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (down 2 per cent) ended as the top losers in the Nifty index. Barring Nifty IT (up 0.72 per cent), all sectoral indices ended lower. Nifty Pharma (down 1.89 per cent), Healthcare (down 1.79 per cent) and Metal (down 1.43 per cent) ended with significant losses. Nifty Bank (down 0.41 per cent) and Financial Services (down 0.39 per cent) also ended lower. Vishal Mega Mart (116.13 crore shares),Vodafone Idea(26.42 crore shares) andKBC Global(22.70 crore shares) were the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NSE. Eight stocks, including Cinevista, KBC Global,Kshitij Polyline, Birla Cable andSterlite Technologies, jumped over 10 per cent on the NSE. As many as 91 stocks, including TechEra Engineering (India), Cinevista, MMTC, JNK India and KBC Global, hit their upper circuits in intraday trade on the NSE. On the other hand, 70 stocks, includingSuven Life Sciences, Sky Gold and Diamonds andReliance Power, hit their lower circuits in intraday trade on the NSE. The advance-decline ratio tilted towards the decliners. While 939 stocks advanced, as many as 1,946 declined, and 76 remained unchanged on the NSE. Some 79 stocks, including Bharat Electronics (BEL), Aditya Birla Capital, Max Healthcare Institute, Muthoot Finance and Solar Industries India, hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE. On the other hand, 48 stocks, including Aditya Vision, Ganesh Benzoplast, Navkar Urbanstructure and Protean eGov Technologies, hit their 52-week lows. According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, a reversal formation on intraday charts and a bearish candle on daily charts indicate temporary weakness. \"We believe that as long as the market is trading below 24,900, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. On the downside, 24,775 would be the immediate support zones for traders. Below this, the market could slip to 24,675-24,625. On the flip side, above 24,900, the sentiment could change. If it moves above this level, it could rally up to 25,000-25,100,\" said Chouhan.

    "title": "Indian stock market: 5 key triggers that could drive Nifty 50 to 26,000 in the short term",
    "body": "The Nifty 50, the benchmark of the Indian stock market, is hovering near 25,600, eyeing a reclaim of the 26,000 mark. The index is now about 3 per cent down from its all-time high of 26,277.35, which it scaled on September 27 last year. Amid global turmoil, tariff-related concerns and weak earnings, the domestic market has performed well in the first half of the calendar year 2025 (H1CY25). On a monthly scale, the Nifty 50 has been in the green since March this year. \"Nifty has managed to absorb most of the negative news in the last two months, from wars and geopolitics to the tariffs. While that was happening, global liquidity was rising. Whether you consider US M2 (measure of the money supply) going higher or the rate cuts in Europe and India. This has kept markets elevated and hopeful that the earnings slowdown will revive into the year-end,\" Rohit Srivastava, the founder and market strategist at Indiacharts.com, observed. The index is expected to scale fresh record highs in the second half of the year, as the medium-term outlook for the market remains positive, supported by the country’s healthy macroeconomic fundamentals and expectations that tariff-related uncertainties will recede. Let's take a look at five key factors that could drive the Nifty 50 to 26,000 or even to uncharted territories in the short term: Investors are focusing on the India-US trade negotiations as the 9 July deadline approaches. So far, only two countries—China and the UK—have signedtrade deals with the US. India and Japan are expected to be the next countries that could strike trade deals with the US. On Friday, Trump said that the White House was looking into anagreement with Indiathat would give it the “right to go in and trade” with the country. Meanwhile, a PTI report, quoting sources, suggested that India-US trade negotiations for an interim trade agreement are progressing well. A favourable trade deal could boost market sentiment, propelling the Nifty 50 to fresh highs. \"One big kicker for the market is the long-awaited US-India trade deal. A lot is expected, and more than anything else, expect the uncertainty to die. Business will be back to normal,\" said Arun Kejriwal, Founder of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. Q1FY26 earnings are expected to be better due to lower inflation, three successive rate cuts by the RBI and healthy macroeconomic growth. \"The larger section of companies is expected to benefit from three successive rate cuts by the RBI. The impact of the first two cuts will be felt on corporations' bottom lines, which should help in better earnings,\" said Kejriwal. Healthy earnings of Indian corporates will ease the concerns over elevated valuations and drive the market to the 26,000 mark or even beyond. The IMD has predicted an above-normal monsoon this year, which is expected to keep food inflation under control. Lower inflation would raise the prospects of further rate cuts by the RBI and reduce input costs for corporates, thereby augmenting their profitability. A healthy and evenly spread monsoon will also underpin market sentiment. G Chokkalingam, the founder and head of research of Equinomics Research Private Limited, pointed out that cumulative rainfall is also in surplus so far. \"As of this morning, cumulative rainfall as of yesterday in June is 8 per cent above the long-term average rainfall. This is a highly positive development for the markets. It can help the output of the agricultural sector to grow significantly and thereby help the overall GDP to grow faster,\" said Chokkalingam. \"A successful monsoon helps in moderating or keeping in check crop prices, and therefore inflation rates tend to remain modest. Already, bothretailand wholesale inflation rates are at record low levels. Therefore, a good monsoon would help in the continuation of the reversal of the interest rate cycle in the economy. The same would help both the economy and corporate world to gain from improvements in aggregate demand in the system,\" said Chokkalingam. The dollar index is hovering near its 52-week low. If it remains in this lower range for an extended period, it could potentially trigger healthy foreign capital inflows into the Indian market, driving it to new highs. \"We are looking at 28,000 by the year-end with the potential of upward revisions as markets price in a move to a dovish Fed in 2026. The falling dollar will drive better inflows into emerging markets, and India stands out as a winner there as well. A good monsoon and lower interest rates should create the growthmomentumfor this year,\" said Srivastava. Experts say if the index holds above 25,700 decisively, it may reclaim the 26,000 mark soon. According to Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research atAnand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, the 25,700–25,900 zone is likely to act as immediate resistance. \"A convincing breakout above this range could pave the way for a new leg higher. However, any close below 25,300 would signal a failed breakout,\" said Patel. Kejriwal said that the Nifty 50 index won't climb to the 26,000 mark quickly without supportive news flow. On the support side, Kejriwal said the 25,200 mark would act as strong support.

    "title": "Nifty 50 gives zero returns in one year! Is the Indian stock market still overvalued?",
    "body": "Following a period of strong outperformance in the past 2–3 years, the Indian equity market has lagged behind its global counterparts in the last year, generating nearly flat returns. In fact, both Indian benchmarks - Sensex andNifty 50- have slipped nearly 2 per cent in last one year, giving negligible returns and raising concerns about stretched valuations in the Indian equity market. “Currently, the index trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 22–23 times, notably above its long-term average, while the price-to-book ratio hovers near 3.4 times and the dividend yield remains modest at approximately 1.3%. Moreover, India’s market-cap-to-GDP ratio has surpassed 139%, a level that typically signals limited upside unless earnings growth accelerates meaningfully,” said Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities. Srivastava further highlighted that the medium- to long-term outlook- of the Indian stock market remains favorable. Historically, theNiftyhas delivered compounded annual returns of 12–17 per cent, supported by India’s structural growth trajectory. India’s growth story is anchored in strong fundamentals rising consumption, digital innovation, and a young, skilled workforce. Government reforms i.e. recent GST 2.0, infrastructure expansion, and initiatives like Make in India and PLI are boosting industrial capacity According to Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, the key reason behind this underperformance has been sustained FII selling, driven by better opportunities in developed markets as well as in countries like China and Germany. “ The recent global market rally has been largely led by AI-related stocks—a theme where India has no direct large-scale players. As a result, most of the incremental flows have been directed towards the US and China. Additionally, corporate earnings in India have remained muted for the past few quarters, while valuations were not particularly attractive. However, valuations have now reached more comfortable levels, and the growth outlook appears promising, which could rekindle FII interest in the Indian market going forward,” Meena said. Seema Srivastava of SMC Global said that India’s long-term trajectory remains robust, despite short-term macro challenges. “With resilient domestic demand and improving corporate governance, it offers compelling opportunities for long-term investors seeking sustainable wealth creation,” she said. Srivastava further explained that themarketis not in a bubble, it is priced for perfection, and current valuations can only be sustained if earnings growth picks up, domestic consumption remains resilient, global monetary conditions ease, and broader sectoral participation improves. “In this scenario, maintaining investment discipline and focusing on carefully chosen stocks becomes essential to manage short-term market volatility,” she added.

    "title": "Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on September 25 after drop in global markets",
    "body": "The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to extend losses for the fifth consecutive session and open lower on Thursday, tracking weakness in global markets. The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a negative start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 25,071 level, a discount of nearly 40 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close. On Wednesday, the equity market indices extended losses for the fourth consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 closing below 25,100 level. TheSensexdropped 386.47 points, or 0.47%, to close at 81,715.63, while the Nifty 50 settled 112.60 points, or 0.45%, lower at 25,056.90. Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50, and Bank Nifty today: Sensex is holding a lower top formation on intraday charts, and on daily charts, it has formed a bearish candle, which is largely negative. “We are of the view that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 81,500 level. Below this,Sensexcould slip to 81,200 - 81,000. On the flip side, above 82,000, the pullback move could extend up to 82,300 - 82,500. The intraday market texture is volatile; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. Mayank Jain, Market Analyst, Share.Market said that the immediate resistance for Sensex is seen at 82,000 – 82,100, and a convincing move above this may propel the index toward 82,500. “On the downside, support lies at 81,200 – 81,000. Breaching this zone could bring 80,500 as the next test for market sentiment,” Jain said. Derivatives positioning reflects a cautious undertone, with call writers continuing to outpace put writers. “Fresh Nifty open interest (OI) addition of 1.12 crore contracts at the 25,500 strike has established this level as a formidable resistance ceiling. Conversely, significant Put OI of 1.14 crore contracts at 25,000 reinforces this band as immediate support. The concurrent buildup of positions on both sides at near-the-money strikes underscores the prevailing indecision, hinting at a likely range-bound phase,” said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) eased to 0.78 from 0.86, tilting sentiment slightly bearish and indicating sellers still maintain an edge. Nifty 50 formed a bearish candle with a lower high and lower low on the daily chart, indicating continued profit booking. “A reasonable bear candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weakness in the market with volatility. Though, Nifty 50 placed at the lows of 4 days decline, still there is no indication of any reversal pattern forming at the lows,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, the short-term trend of the market continues to be negative.Nifty 50is now sliding down to the crucial lower support of 24,900 levels as per weekly chart. Immediate resistance is placed at 25,150. Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research), Centrum Broking Ltd. noted that the Nifty 50 has now completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 24,404 to the recent peak of 25,448, with the key level around 25,050. “A decisive move below this level could open the door for further downside towards 24,920, which coincides with the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as the 50% retracement of the recent uptrend. Despite the ongoing weakness, the broader structure remains positive as long as Nifty 50 holds above 24,900. On the upside, a breakout above 25,150 would invalidate the current bearish setup and may trigger a short-covering rally towards 25,300,” said Jain. Mayank Jain said that the immediate resistance for Nifty 50 is at 25,200 – 25,250, and a decisive break above this level may lift the index toward 25,350. Strong support is placed at 25,000 – 24,950, and if this zone breaks, then maybe 24,800 will act as the support. Bank Nifty slipped 388.25 points, or 0.70%, to close at 55,121.50 on Wednesday, forming a bearish candle, with the day’s high remaining much lower than the previous session’s high, reflecting a slight loss of positive momentum. “Bank Nifty has closed below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 55,270 and is now about to test the 38.2% retracement. Slipping below this level may drag the index further towards the 50% retracement near the 54,700 zone. On the higher side, 55,500 has become immediate resistance, and only a decisive close above this mark would alleviate the current pressure. On the hourly timeframe, Nifty Bank is consolidating around 55,100, with repeated rejections near the 55,300 levels,” said Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. The RSI has dropped to 51 on the daily chart and slipped near 40 on the hourly timeframe, reflecting a loss of strength. The daily MACD remains in positive territory. “The broader trend remains constructive above the 20-day moving average (DMA) at 54,620, but the near-term setup suggests extended consolidation with a downward trend. Unless Nifty Bank closes back above 55,500, the index may drift lower towards 54,800 – 54,600,” Mehra said. According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities, the 55,100 – 55,000 zone will act as an immediate support forBank Nifty, and a sustained move below 55,000 can lead to the throwback extending further in the Index towards 54,500. “On the upside, the zone of 55,500 - 55,600 is likely to act as an immediate resistance. Any follow through buying above this zone can lead to resumption of uptrend in the Index,” said Shah. Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivative Research, Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd. highlighted that the Bank Nifty index formed a red candle on the daily scale, signalling persistent selling pressure. “On the downside, immediate support is placed at 54,800, followed by 54,500. On the upside, the zone of 56,000 – 56,160 will act as a significant resistance. Hence, adopting a buy-near-support and sell-near-resistance approach is recommended in Bank Nifty for the short term,” said Yedve.

    "title": "Indian stock market: Nifty 50 falls below 25,300. Can it slip back to 25,000?",
    "body": "Indian stock market:Indian equities began Monday’s session on a weaker note, extending the previous round of profit-taking, with IT stocks weighing the most after the U.S. sharply increased the one-time H-1B visa fee to $100,000 (₹88 lakh). The move dampened sentiment in a sector that had only recently begun to recover. At the opening bell, the S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.37 per cent to 82,323.62, down 302.61 points, while the NSENifty 50slipped 0.26 per cent to 25,260, losing 67.05 points. By around 9:30 AM, the Sensex was trading 182 points, or 0.22 per cent, lower at 82,443, and the Nifty50 was down 40 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 25,288. “Last week's achievement of the 25400-600 objective, along with an evening star candle formation prompts us to look for a pull back instead of extending upside objectives right away. Favoured rest point is 24880-800. However, should slippages not stretch beyond the 25200-25000 region, we could as well be seeing a sideways move, followed by recovery attempts, though an outright penetration of 25669 is less expected,” said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. TheNiftyindex displayed strong bullish momentum over the past week, advancing 213 points and forming a bullish candle, marking the third consecutive week of gains. According to Amruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst, Choice Broking, The index has held firmly above the 25,300 mark, closing at 25,327. Nifty continues to trade above its key moving averages—the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—further confirming the broader bullish undertone. “As long as the index remains above these moving averages, market sentiment is expected to stay constructive. On the upside, immediate resistance levels are seen at 25,500, followed by 25,600 and 25,850. On the downside, support is placed at 25,150 and then at 25,000, with a deeper breakdown below 24,900 likely to trigger additional downside pressure,” Shinde said. Support Levels:- 25150-25000 Resistance Levels:- 25600-25850 Overall Bias:- Sideways To Bullish BankNiftyended the week on a positive note, closing at 55,458.85 after recovering nearly 649 points during the week. The index has demonstrated resilience by sustaining above the 55,400 mark and closing in the green for the third consecutive week. “If the buying momentum continues and the index decisively crosses 55,750, it could pave the way for further upside towards 56,000 and 56,500 levels. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 55,000. A sustained breakdown below this level could trigger fresh selling pressure, with potential targets at 54,830 and 54,500,” Shinde said.

    "body": "The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has become the first Indian exchange to get an exemption from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that will allow members of the Indian bourse to trade in derivatives for U.S. clients. “The order issued to NSE permits its members to accept U.S. customer funds directly for the purpose of trading in futures and options contracts on NSE without the members having to register with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant,” stated a release by the NSE. “The [CFTC] issued a Part 30 exemptive order dated May 17, 2018 to the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) as part of its program of regulatory deference to foreign regulatory frameworks. Part 30 exemptive program of CFTC provides U.S. customers with increased access to foreign futures markets,” the release added. CFTC is an independent agency of the U.S. government that regulates the futures and options markets and monitors various organisations related to derivatives clearing, futures commission merchants and swap data repositories among others. SEC recognition for BSE Incidentally, the development comes just days after the BSE becoming the first Indian exchange to be recognised as a Designated Offshore Securities Market (DOSM) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The DOSM status allows the sale of securities to U.S. investors through the trading venue of BSE without registration of such securities with the U.S. SEC and thus eases the trades by U.S. investors in India.",

    "title": "NSE applies for extending equity derivatives trading hours till midnight: Sources",
    "body": "The National Stock Exchange has written to capital and commodity market regulator SEBI, seeking approval to extend the time of equity derivatives trading till nearly midnight, sources told Moneycontrol. The NSE, India's top stock exchange, is looking to start a second trading session between 5:00 pm and 11:55 pm, only for equity derivatives, after the regular session ends at 3.30 pm. It is not clear whether trading will be held in single-stock derivatives or only index derivatives in the absence of a cash market during the second session. In May this year, SEBI hadallowed stock exchangesto hold trading in derivatives between 9 am and 11.55 pm. NSE accounts for about 90 percent market share in equity derivatives in India. The other major exchange, BSE, has not been known to have applied for an extension in trading times, even though both exchanges tend to align their trading sessions with each other. Currently, commodities exchanges such as MCX and NCDEX conduct trading in derivatives of some agri and non-agri commodities. Brokers saythey would resistany move to keep trading open till midnight, as they do not see enough business post regular trading hours to compensate for the additional operating costs they will have to incur. Plus there are also concerns on how effectively an equity derivatives market will work in the absence of a functioning cash market. A market participant told Moneycontrol, \"On the commodity side, SEBI is trying to connect the spot price to the futures price but there will be a disconnect on the equity side, which will close for trading at 3:30 pm.\" Many trades, such as hedging or arbitrage, require traders to initiate positions in both the cash and the derivatives market to work effectively. A source close to SEBI told Moneycontrol that the regulator had \"given the option\" to exchanges on the issue of extending trading times. \"Whether they want to increase it or not, it depends on the exchanges,\" the source said.

    "body": "An SGX sign is pictured at Singapore Stock Exchange July 19, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Singapore Exchange (SGX) said on Saturday a court-appointed arbitrator had told it to continue listing and trading SGX Nifty contracts beyond August 2018, during a dispute resolution with India's National Stock Exchange (NSE). The two exchanges have been locked in dispute after India's three main bourses unexpectedly announced in February they would stop licensing their indexes to foreign bourses from August. SGX responded that it would launch successor products to its flagship Indian equity derivative products on June 4. Now NSE and SGX have been ordered \"to facilitate the continued listing of SGX Nifty products for at least two successive contract month maturations beyond the arbitration's completion date\", SGX said in a statement. The arbitrator has also asked SGX not to offer its proposed new India equity derivative products until the final decision, it said. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"Arbitration proceedings are continuing and the hearings on evidence are expected to commence in early 2019,\" the statement said. SGX had postponed the launch of a set of new India derivatives products after an Indian court in May referred a dispute around the proposed offerings to an arbitrator. In a statement issued on Saturday, NSE also confirmed the interim order of the arbitrator. The NSE had sought an interim injunction against the launch on grounds that the offerings infringed the intellectual property rights of its unit India Index Services and Products (IISL), which runs the Nifty index. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The Bombay High Court then asked a senior retired judge to arbitrate in the matter, and resolve the issue by June 16. However, the June 16 interim order, which was reviewed by Reuters, laid out a timeline for filing of claims and counter-claims and set Nov. 21 for hearing of the issues, with further directions to be provided on June 18. Over the past two decades, SGX has become the most popular market for foreign investors to bet on Indian equity indexes, with Nifty 50 futures SINc1 tracking the NSE's main index .NSEI. Advertisement · Scroll to continue But NSE, BSE Ltd and Metropolitan Stock Exchange moved to end licensing deals with foreign bourses so as to stem the loss of trades to overseas rivals, following SGX's plans to launch trade in single-stock futures contracts. The Indian government backed the decision, as it is keen to draw investors to an international financial centre being developed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's western home state of Gujarat, sources say.

    "body": "Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has started investigating last week’s technical glitches and trading halts at the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the Multi Commodity Exchange Ltd (MCX), two people aware of the matter said. “The regulator has sought a report from both the exchanges that have suffered technical glitches and trading halts for the second time within a year. Sebi will analyse the reports by the two exchanges and will respond in terms of corrective measures and actions,” said one of the two people quoted above. An email sent to a Sebi spokesperson was not answered. NSE was forced to halt trading for around three hours at the start of 10 July last year because of technical issues. On Thursday, it’s Neat on Web (NOW) systems suffered a software shutdown during trading hours. Normal trading was not disrupted as the members had alternative modes of connectivity during the disruptions. A spokesperson for NSE said, “NOW is a shared CTCL system which had a temporary disruption and has been rectified on the same day and the system was up and running. NSE trading platform is completely different and functioned smoothly with full efficiency that day.” MCX suffered a trading halt in September last year and a repeat occurred on Friday when trading was halted twice. The first time, the systems halted for more than an hour at 7:12 pm and a second time at 10:11 pm. Normal trading resumed at 11 pm. “Data integrity and other checks have been performed to satisfy and assure that there has been no impact on any of the surveillance, risk margining and any other pre or post-trade activities,” said MCX but declined to comment on a specific query. MCX’s preliminary analysis shows that there was some aberration in the low-level network layer but a detailed analysis of hardware and underlying operating systems is pending. “It is the frequency of trading disruptions that is worrying. While Sebi typically has not penalised exchanges for trading disruptions, it cannot be ruled out if it causes any loss to market sanctity,” said the second person quoted above. “There is certainly a need to strengthen the monitoring system. Sebi will ensure that there is a proper monitoring of the technology being dispensed and that no investor is put at loss due to disruption,” he said. Due to malfunction at NOW, thousands of orders placed by hundreds of brokers were repeated by the system a number of times and in some cases, hundreds of times resulting into unintended trades for brokers/clients. The Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) in a communication has even requested NSE for compensation as system fired multiple orders on its own, resulting in trades. “It was not a breakdown of trading, rather a malfunction which resulted in firing of multiple orders resulting in trades from NSE’s NOW system,” said ANMI in a communication to Sebi, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint. The Indian Council of Investors, an investor association, has also written to Sebi calling for unintended trades at NSE to be annulled. “Brokers/investors should not be made to face the adverse consequences and financial loss resulting from this system malfunction of NOW,” said the investor association in the letter.

    "title": "NSE to launch weekly options on Nifty index",
    "body": "ThinkStock Photos The weekly options of the Nifty index will have seven consecutive weekly expiry contracts excluding the week where monthly contracts expire. NEW DELHI: National Stock Exchange of India has secured permission from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to launch weekly options on the Nifty index. The launch of options contracts on the 50-stock index is likely to increase volumes in the option segment and provide a hedging tool to market participants. The exchange had launched weekly options on the Bank Nifty in 2016 and more recently, it had launched weekly options in the currency derivatives segment on the USD-INR currency pair. “With the successful launch of weekly options on the Nifty Bank index, there was demand from the market participants for a similar product variant of the NIFTY 50 index. The weekly options on Nifty50 index provides an additional hedging tool for market participants to manage the portfolio risk more effectively,\" said Vikram Limaye, MD & CEO of NSE . The NSE said that it is currently evaluating the readiness of market participants for the product launch and will announce a launch date shortly. Live Events The weekly options of the Nifty index will have seven consecutive weekly expiry contracts excluding the week where monthly contracts expire. \"It could push the volume and participation in options segment like in Bank Nifty weekly contracts, which is seeing huge participation. Already, index option segment has contribution of 90 per cent turnover in the total turnover of NSE F&O segment,\" said Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal. Taparia said traders could get opportunity to do pair trading in the Nifty and Bank Nifty weekly options. On expiry of a weekly contract, exchange will introduce next weekly contract on rolling basis. The existing three monthly options contracts, three quarterly and eight semi-annual option contracts will also continue to be available, said NSE. The contracts will expire on Thursday of every week. In case the Thursday is a trading holiday, the previous trading day will be the expiry/last trading day, said NSE. The exchange said that the strike interval for the weekly options will remain the same as monthly contracts. Rajesh Baheti, President of Association of National Exchanges Members of India believes that the weekly options on Nifty index will increase volume across the market but there could be a drawback in terms of higher liquidity in the weekly options contracts compared to the monthly options contracts. \"Liquidity on the monthly Nifty options contracts may go down if market participants start trading more in the weekly options,\" said Baheti. Baheti believes that unlike the Bank Nifty weekly options, the launch of Nifty weekly options will not lead to a significant increase in volatility as the Nifty is a broad based index while Bank Nifty is dominated mainly by two stocks.

We are in touch with NSE to have this fixed,\" brokerage firm Zerodha said in a tweet. Retail traders also complained of some issue with live ticks for NSE indices. NSEIndia later tweeted that engineers are working on restoring the systems as soon as possible. \"In view of the above, all the segments have been closed at 11:40 and will be restored as soon as issue is resolved,\" it tweeted. \"NSE has multiple telecom links with two service providers to ensure redundancy. We have received communication from both the telecom service providers that there are issues with their links due to which there is an impact on NSE system,\" another tweet by NSEIndia reads. Earlier on Tuesday, the National Stock Exchange announced changes in index maintenance guidelines, criteria and methodology. From March 31, there will be changes to revision in the index reconstitution date, stock capping, quarterly rebalancing of shares and investible weight factors, and calculation of Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio for indices.

    "title": "NSE IFSC to introduce trading in US Stocks",
    "body": "IFSC As one of the largest and fastest growing economies , India has been a major consumer of International financial services (IFS). The 2007 report of the committee set up by the Ministry of Finance (popularly known as the Percy Mistry Committee Report) had estimated that even under conservative assumptions, purchases by Indian households and firms of IFS will be nearly $50 billion by 2015, and could exceed $120 billion by 2025. Thus, with the objective of bringing back to India the international financial service business generated from India, and gradually emerge as an international financial services hub at the regional and global level, Government of India operationalized India’s maiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT Multi Services SEZ in April 2015. IFSCA The International Financial Services Centres Authority Act was passed in December 2019 and the IFSCA commenced its operation as a unified regulator in October 2020. The IFSCA has been vested with the combined powers of four domestic regulators namely RBI, SEBI, IRDAI and PFRDA and has a mandate to develop and regulate financial institutions, financial services, and financial products within the IFSCs in India. The strategic objectives of IFSCA are as follows: To position the IFSC as a leading internationally recognized centre with trusted business and tax regulation, and judicial & dispute resolution system. To become a gateway for global capital flows into and out of India. To emerge as a regional/global hub for international financial services. NSE IFSC to introduce trading in US Stocks NSE International Exchange has announced that trading in select US Stocks will soon be facilitated through the NSE IFSC platform. The offering will be in the form of unsponsored depository receipts. IFSCA has facilitated the same under the Regulatory Sandbox. The entire trading, clearing, settlement and holding of US Stocks will be under the regulatory structure of IFSC Authority, stated an official release here Monday. This initiative is a first-of-its-kind at IFSC where Indian retail investors will be able to transact on the NSE IFSC platform under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) limits prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it added. The business model offered by NSE IFSC will not only provide an additional investment opportunity to the Indian investors but also make the entire process of investment easy and low-cost. Investors will be provided with an option to trade in fractional quantity / value when compared to the underlying shares traded in US markets. The proposed framework will make US stocks affordable to Indian retail investors. NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation Limited (NICCL) is to offer its robust risk management framework, facilitate clearing and settlement of all trades in depository receipts and provide settlement guarantee in respect to all trades executed on the NSE IFSC platform. Furthermore, all the trades will be covered under the investor protection framework at NSE IFSC.

    "title": "NSE VS BSE | How NSE Beat BSE to Become India's Top Stock Exchange",
    "body": "Stock exchanges are the powerful platforms or marketplaces that allow us to invest or trade in securities. Most beginners in the stock market have a doubt regarding the exchange they should transact in— whether it should be BSE or NSE. In this article, we dive into the two prominent stock exchanges of India. We shall also analyse the factors that helped NSE become our country’s largest stock market exchange. TheBombay Stock Exchange(BSE) was established way back in 1875. Located in Dalal Street, Mumbai, it is the oldest stock exchange in Asia.There are more than 5,400 companies listed on the BSE. Its benchmark index, theS&P BSE Sensex, is widely tracked by investors across the globe. The Sensex (Sensitive Index) tracks the performance of 30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE. As of 2020,BSE is the 10th largest exchange in the worldin terms of the cumulative market capitalisation of all companies listed on its platform. TheNational Stock Exchange(NSE) was incorporated in 1992. It is also located in Mumbai. NSE is ranked the third-largest stock exchange globally in terms of the total number of trades in equity shares.There are more than 1,600 companies listed on the NSE. It is the first bourse in India to implementelectronic or screen-based trading. TheNifty 50is NSE’s benchmark index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest companies listed on its platform. Both NSE and BSE provide a platform for companies to raise funds efficiently.The exchanges allow investors to trade in equities, currencies, debt instruments, derivatives (F&O), and mutual funds. Moreover, they provide services such as risk management, clearing and settlement, and investor education. The exchanges operate under the strict guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). For more than a century, BSE had complete dominance over stock trading in India. To break this monopoly and improve transparency in the capital market, our government decided to create the NSE. It wasIndia’s first computer-driven stock exchangeand was promoted by some of the leading financial institutions at that time. NSE was given the right to set uptrading terminalsacross the country, while BSE was not allowed to do so. [Trading terminals are intermediary software that allows investors and traders to place buy/sell orders without having to call their brokers]. Meanwhile, it took a few years for BSE to receive permission for the same. Thus, NSE was able to capture a significant portion of share trading across India. They used state-of-the-art technologies to ramp up the performance of trading systems.NSE was the pioneer of automated and paperless trading in the Indian market. It set up the firstdepository— the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), which initiated the demat revolution in the country. NSE was also the first stock exchange to establish a clearing corporation (NSE Clearing Limited), which helps reduce trading and settlement risks in the market. With the arrival of NSE, investing and trading in stock markets became highly transparent, efficient, and less costly. Ever since NSE was established in 1992, there has been fierce competition between the two bourses for attracting more trading volumes. Higher volumes would ultimately allow exchanges to obtain more revenue. More importantly, it would lead to betterliquidity, an aspect that is vital while trading in shares and derivatives. Higher liquidity allows traders to quickly and easily buy or sell shares at the exact price specified by them. As a result of its revolutionary offerings,NSE has the highest average daily turnover for equity shares than any other stock market in India. The turnover for an exchange refers to the overall value of shares traded during a certain period. Let’s look at an example. On July 12, 2021, around 15.76 lakh shares of Reliance Industries were traded on the BSE. At the same time, ~39.6 lakh shares of RIL were traded on the NSE— more than double! Since NSE has high trading volumes, the price a buyer offers per share (bid price) and the price the seller is willing to accept (ask price) will be fairly close to each other. This helps intraday and swing traders enter and exit a trade at the exact price specified by them and realise their targets. For those who are not aware of whatderivatives tradingreally is, here’s a quick explanation: A derivative is an instrument whose value is derived from an underlying asset. The underlying can be a stock, commodity, index, etc. Derivatives are used by large institutions or traders to hedge risk and to speculate on price changes in the underlying asset. Futures and options (F&O) are the most common types of derivatives trading. An agreement (or contract) can be formed between a buyer and seller to buy/sell a predetermined quantity of the underlying asset at a specified price on a specified date. You can learn more about basic options termshere. Coming back to the point,NSE has always been the most liquid exchange for derivatives. It is the undisputed leader when it comes to futures and options (F&O) trading. This is clear when you compare the volumes (options chain) of F&O activated stocks on NSE and BSE. In most instances, there are zero contracts formed in BSE. On the other hand, NSE’s Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty are traded heavily in the stock market. Despite its exceptional growth, NSE lags behind BSE on one aspect: the brand. Sensex is still widely used across the world to measure the health of the Indian markets and the economy. To summarise, NSE is the preferred exchange for intraday, swing, and derivatives trading due to high liquidity. If you are a long-term investor, it does not really matter where you buy/sell shares. However, BSE gives access to more than 5,000 stocks across various sectors. There could be a minor/insignificant difference in the prices of scrips in NSE and BSE. The costs related to investing and trading are similar for both exchanges. Over the past few years, stock exchanges have come under the scanner due to frequent technical glitches. You may recall the four-hour-long halt in NSE’s trading system that occurred inFebruary 2021. The exchange informed that the instability of telecom links from two of its service providers had affected the functioning of its risk management system. Unfortunately, it resulted in heavy losses for investors. There was a complete lack of accountability from NSE. Recently, SEBI came out with a standard operating procedure (SOP) to curb technical glitches in stock market operations. NSE and BSE could face a penalty of up to Rs 2 crore or more if they fail to respond to technical disruptions within 30 minutes and restore operations within 45 minutes. Stock exchanges and other market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) will have to submit a root cause analysis report within 21 days of an accident. Let us hope such events do not occur in the future! Thanks for sharing such a good analysis Really a very good topic. Very good explanation. Honeykomb by BHIVE,19th Main Road,HSR Sector 3,Karnataka - 560102",

    "title": "NSE tech glitch: SEBI seeks explanation for not migrating to disaster recovery site",
    "body": "Markets regulator SEBI on Wednesday asked the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to explain why trading on the bourse did not migrate to a disaster recovery site after facing connectivity issues. NSE should carry out a root cause analysis of the reasons for the trading halt, a statement from SEBI said, adding that it was in constant touch with NSE officials all through the day and monitored the situation closely. Trading on NSE, India's largest bourse which handles over 90% of the volumes, came to a halt on Wednesday morning due to what the exchange termed as issues with telecom connectivity. Activity in some segments started facing glitches since around 10 am, within minutes of the markets opening at 0915 hrs, and all activity at NSE ground to a halt at 11.40 am. \"In view of the exceptional situation arising out of the trading halt, it was decided to extend the trading hours from 1530 hrs to 1700 hrs at NSE, BSE and MSEI,\" the SEBI statement said. The NSE should \"explain the reasons for trading not migrating to the disaster recovery site\" and asked it to submit a report at the earliest, according to an official statement. A disaster recovery system helps as a plan-B in times of distress to ensure that activity is not affected. Trading across segments was halted at 11.40 am on Wednesday due to \"issues with the links with telecom service providers\", according to the NSE. The bourse said it depends on two telecom service providers for connectivity, and both failed simultaneously resulting in the outage. \"The NSE was also advised to keep the market participants updated with the evolving developments,\" it said. In an unprecedented move, the bourses extended their trading hours till 5 pm as against the usual end of trade at 3.30 pm hrs, probably to make up for lost volumes. However, even after extended trading hours, the overall volumes could not touch the usual averages, NSE data showed. In the equities market, the value of securities traded on Wednesday stood at Rs 45,837 crore, as against an average daily turnover of Rs 72,472 crore in January in the cash segment. Similarly, in the equity derivatives segment, the total futures and options turnover stood at Rs 30.59 lakh crore on Wednesday, as against Rs 40.32 lakh crore on Tuesday. In June 2020, NSE's bank option segment prices were not reflecting on the terminal linked to the exchange. In September 2019 too, the bourse's system faced a trading outage as investors were unable to place orders in the final minutes of trade. Jimeet Modi, founder and chief executive at Samco Ventures, a brokerage, said there is a precedent of complete annulment of trades on Muhurat trading day on BSE Futures and Options segment in 2011. Commenting on Wednesday's outage, he said, \"The biggest question in this whole issue is why was the entire market shut just because index feeds were not refreshing? Feeds for underlying contracts were fine and so was order matching, so why shut down the entire market? \" \"SEBI and NSE need to quickly look at alternatives here if this isn't getting fixed,\" he added. Tata Communications and Bharti Airtel take care of NSE's connectivity. However, there was no statement from the companies. The NSE's 50-share benchmark Nifty gained 1.86% to close at 14,982 points on Wednesday. BSE's 30-share benchmark gained 2.07% to 50,781 points.",

    "title": "Glitch disrupts NSE trading for 4 hours in longest such outage",
    "body": "Stocks turned in dramatic gains of nearly 2% in a late surge on Wednesday, capping a turbulent day that saw trading on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), India’s largest, disrupted for nearly four hours because of a technical glitch. The outage, the longest such in the country, prompted NSE and its main rival BSE to extend trading hours until 5pm on Wednesday to allow investors to close their positions ahead of Thursday’s expiry of monthly derivatives contracts. Many investors couldn’t as brokerages squared off open positions to mitigate risks. NSEaccounts for 80% of India’s trading volume in derivatives. Also Read|India’s tricky options in the Myanmar muddle The first signs of a problem were noticed about an hour into trading at 10.06am as traders complained that NSE’s benchmark Nifty index, as well as the Nifty Bank Index, had stopped updating. After about an hour of confusion, at 11.40am, the exchange halted trading in all segments, including derivatives and cash, citing ‘issues’ with the telecom links of its two service providers, which it claimed caused the system to stop updating prices. As trading resumed at 3.45pm, in a special session, stocks surged, confounding investors with the sheer velocity of the rally. Analysts said the rally was prompted by investors and brokerages trying to square off trades. BSE continued normal trading in all segments through the extended trading day. After trading came to a halt on NSE, the exchange notified traders that it received communication from its telecom service providers that there are issues with their links. “We are working on restoring the systems as soon as possible. In view of the above, all segments have been closed at 11.40am and will be restored as soon as the issue is resolved,” an NSE spokesperson said in a statement in the afternoon. Brokers, however, were puzzled as to why trading could not be switched over to NSE’s backup site in Chennai and the unusual time taken by the exchange to communicate to investors. The backup site is a replica of the primary site and is aimed at ensuring trading activity does not stop even if there is a technical glitch. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has advised NSE to carry out a detailed analysis of the circumstances that caused the snag. Market participants and brokerages said NSE could have handled the situation better. Traders said those with open positions in the derivatives segment were on tenterhooks till NSE communicated about a resolution plan at 3.30pm. Many customers who trade in the futures and options (F&O) segment on NSE could not exit, and brokerages squared off positions by 4pm. “While the extended trading session helped many F&O customers exit their positions, it created confusion among customers whose positions had been squared off,” said Zerodha, an online brokerage with the highest number of retail clients. If NSE had informed brokers of a potential reopening or extension of trading hours, at least by 3pm, brokers would not have had to take risk-mitigation measures and square off positions on BSE, Zerodha said. “Unfortunately, because there were no updates, we had no other choice. The last-minute notification of the trading extension at 3:17pm came a little too late,” Zerodha said. Bharti Airtel, one of the telecom service providers to NSE, has received no communication from NSE, said a person aware of the matter. “Airtel is awaiting NSE’s RCA (root cause analysis) of the technical snag. Based on RCA, the company will move forward and respond accordingly,” said a person aware of the matter. The BSE Sensex rose 1,030.28 points, or 2.07%, to 50,781.69. The 50-share index Nifty gained 1.86% to 14,982. “Volumes on NSE were expectedly lower than the recent average. However, volumes on BSE at₹40,700 crore were the highest since March 2017, due to diversion of trades,” said Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities. “We have taken the matter seriously and have sought a report from Sebi at the earliest,” a finance ministry official said under condition of anonymity.

Within an hour of the stock market opening on 24 February, the first signs of trouble appeared. A little past 10 AM, the exchange feeds of the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) for its widely tracked indices, including the Nifty, stopped across brokerages. Trading continued for about 90 minutes on India’s premier stock exchange before it was abruptly halted. What followed was an unprecedented four-hour closure—the longest outage in NSE’s 29-year history. The chaos and confusion this unleashed was compounded by the lack of communication from the exchange until it was too late. The extended trading session announced just minutes before the market’s usual closing time was little comfort for many traders who had to suffer losses for no fault of their own. Their intraday positions on NSE had been closed by brokers on the rival BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) a few minutes earlier to prevent penalties, had NSE not re-opened for trading. The losses, outrage, and embarrassment the outage caused put NSE firmly on the backfoot. Even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that it cost the government “immensely”. The exchange blamed instability in telecom links and a vendor making inappropriate changes to technical equipment; these claims are being closely scrutinised. Written byAnand Kalyanaraman",

    "title": "Share Market Timings in India",
    "body": "Last Updated: 26 Sep 2025 To effectively trade or invest in the financial markets, you need to have the proper knowledge about the stock market timings in India. All over the country, theshare markettimings are the same. Therefore, once you get to know what the stock market timings are, you can buy, sell, or invest in shares from any part of the country during that time. These timings are also the same whether you want to trade on any of the two major stock exchanges in India, namely the BSE and the NSE. The regular market trading hours are from 09:15 AM to 03:30 PM. There’s a pre-opening session before 09:15 AM and a post-closing session after 03:30 PM, conducted after India stock market hours. Here is the Indian stock market opening time and closing time, along with the sessions that take place during the course of the day. used to evaluate buy and sell orders to determine the opening price. The pre-opening session starts at 09:00 AM and goes on till 09:15 AM. It’s further divided into three sections. During one of these time slots, you can place orders to buy or sell shares for a limited period. Let’s look at the details of the pre-opening session below. You can use these 8 minutes to place an order to buy or sell various shares on the stock market. You can also change or cancel any orders you have placed. Once the regular market starts at 09:15 AM, the ones executed during this part of the pre-opening session take priority in the queue of orders. You can’t place new orders, change existing orders or cancel orders during these 4 minutes. This section is required to carry out price matching by comparing supply and demand. It is used to calculate the prices at which various shares will be traded when the market opens at 09:15 AM. This 3-minute window of time is like a connection section between the pre-opening session and the normal trading hours. It behaves like a buffer to ease the transition into the regular trading session. Again, during these 3 minutes as well, you cannot place, modify, or cancel any orders. This is known as the continuous trading session. It runs from 09:15 AM to 03:30 PM. You are able to buy and sell stock freely during this session, and you are able to place buy or sell orders for stock as well as modify or cancel those buy or sell orders without any restrictions. An order-matching mechanism is adopted within the window. Every sell order is thus against a buy order at the same stock price, and every buy order is against the buy order at the same stock price. This session begins when the regular trading session comes to a close at 03:30 PM. The post-closing session, which runs up to 04:00 PM, consists of two sections. In these 10 minutes, the closing prices of stocks are calculated by taking the weighted average of the stock prices traded between 03:00 PM and 03:30 PM. The closing prices ofindiceslike Sensex and Nifty are calculated by considering the weighted average prices of all the securities that are listed in that index. In this 20-minute section, you can still place buy and sell orders. But the orders are confirmed only if there are sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers in the market. Here’s how you can invest in the stock market step by step: Pick a broker or trading app. Complete your KYC and registration. Add money to your account using bank transfer or other payment options. Check company details, market trends, and reports. Beginners can start with blue-chip stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs. Buy stocks through your broker or app. Begin small and increase slowly. Invest in different sectors to reduce risk. Track the market to keep your stocks aligned with your goals. Stock market timings define the hours during which trading activities take place. Markets operate in sessions. These include pre-market, regular trading, and post-market periods. Let’s analyse theequity market time in Indiain detail: Stock market closing times in India are divided into two key trading sessions: morning and afternoon. These sessions define when investors can engage in trading before the market shuts for the day. – Opening Time: The India stock market start time is 9:15 AM IST. – Closing Time: 12:30 PM IST. – The market sees high activity as global trends influence early trades. – Opening Time: 12:30 PM IST. – Closing Time: The Market closes at 3:30 PM IST, marking the end of share market trading timings in India. – Investors make final trades before the closing bell. Additionally, different exchanges may have variations in the India stock market trading time, especially for post-market and after-hours trading Aftermarket orders give investors a chance to trade even after the stock market closes. This is useful when big news or announcements come after hours. In India, brokerages accept these orders between 4 PM and 9 AM for the next day’s market open. This way, investors can react to overnight developments, secure better prices, or adjust their portfolios. It allows more flexibility and helps them prepare strategically for the next trading session. On most public and national holidays, the Indian stock market stays closed. But there is a special one-hour session called Muhurat trading on Diwali. This tradition exists because Diwali is considered an auspicious day for wealth and prosperity. The exact timing of this session changes each year and is announced in advance. Many investors participate during this hour, often using share trading apps, to mark the beginning of their financial year with positive investments. Being aware of share market timings in India is vital to earn profits, especially if you pursueintraday trading. All you need is anonline Demat accountandtrading accountto get started on your journey of trading or investing in the share market.

    "title": "Is the Indian stock market closed today for Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi?",
    "body": "Stock market holiday:As Eid-e-Milad, which marks the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad, is being celebrated today, September 5, investors may get confused whether the Indian stock market will be open or closed for trading. According to thestock market holiday calendarshared by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE, trading activities on the BSE and NSE will remain open today, which means today is not a stock market holiday. The Indian stock market will be open for trading during for regular trading on Friday. As per the calendar,in the month of September, there are no additional holidaysapart from the weekends. Considering that, the Indian stock market will be closed for trading on eight days in September. The next stock market holiday will now fall in the month of October. According to the stock market holiday calendar, NSE and BSE will remain closed for trading for five days during the week over the next three months. In October, the stock market will be closed for trading on three days. The first holiday in October will fall on October 2 for Dussehra and Gandhi Jayanti. Thereafter, BSE and NSE will be closed for trading on October 21 and October 22 for Diwali Laxmi Pujan and Balipratipada. Meanwhile, in November and December, there is one market holiday each for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and Christmas, respectively. Here's a look at stock market holidays in the rest of 2025: The Indian benchmark indices, after a strong rally in early trade,ended on a flat note on Thursday, as losses in Reliance Industries and IT stocks weighed. While the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) Council approved a shift to a two-rate structure from the existing four and cut levies on everyday items, boosting auto and FMCG stocks, concerns around US tariffs lingered. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 0.08% higher at 24,734, and the BSE Sensex gained 0.19% to 80,718.01. In early trade, both indices had jumped 1.1%. \"In-line outcome of GST rationalisation and ongoing tariff threats from the US exerted a negative impact on the market today. Given that the US is India's largest export destination, accounting for 2.2% of the GDP, the repercussions are inevitable. Companies are exploring ways to maintain exports to their existing clients through strategies like cross-country billing and setting up manufacturing units abroad. However, exports are expected to slow down and hinder new growth opportunities,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited. On the brighter side, the GST rate cut is expected to significantly boost domestic consumption demand, countering the adverse effects of diminished export competitiveness, he added.

    "body": "Both NSE and BSE will remain open on September 8, with trading beginning as usual at 9:15 AM, unaffected by the festive celebrations. New Delhi:India’s festive season kicked off in September with Eid-e-Milad and Onam being celebrated across different parts of the country. Despite the festivities, stock market operations have continued without disruption. However, a bit of confusion did arise among traders and investors over whether the markets would remain open on September 8, after the RBI shifted the earlier-declared money market holiday from September 5 to September 8. Both NSE and BSE will remain open on September 8, with trading beginning as usual at 9:15 AM, unaffected by the festive celebrations. Add Zee News as a Preferred Source Yes, but only the money market. The Maharashtra government has shifted the money market holiday from September 5 to September 8, which was earlier aligned with Eid-e-Milad. This change was made to keep settlement cycles smooth on September 5. However, equity markets will remain unaffected. Trading will continue as usual on September 8 and on all other weekdays for the rest of September 2025. (Also Read: Notification On Handling Goods Stocked Under Higher GST Slabs Soon) Because of the Eid-e-Milad settlement holiday on September 8, mutual fund transactions will see slight changes in processing. Any purchase or redemption requests made after the cut-off time on September 5 in liquid or debt schemes will now be processed on September 9. Transactions like allotments and redemptions set for September 8 will be settled a day later, on September 9. The only exception is equity schemes, which will be processed as usual on September 8. Redemption fund payouts, however, will not take place on September 5 or September 8.

    "title": "Stock Market Holiday: Are BSE, NSE open or closed today for Eid-e-Milad 2025?",
    "body": "ETMarkets.com Indian stock exchanges will operate as usual today, September 5, despite the observance of Milad-Un-Nabi. Trading follows a fixed holiday calendar, and Milad-Un-Nabi is not listed as a full-day market holiday. The commodity segment will also remain open, with no break in either the morning or afternoon sessions. Also known as Eid-e-Milad, the day marks the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. It is observed in the third month of the Islamic calendar, Rabi-ul-Awwal. However, today will be a settlement holiday , meaning that settlement and transactions carried out on Thursday will be shifted to Monday. What is a settlement holiday? Unlike a trading holiday, when the stock exchanges NSE and BSE are shut and investors cannot buy or sell shares, on a settlement holiday the exchanges remain open for trading, but clearing and settlement of trades do not take place because banks, depositories such as NSDL and CDSL , or the RBI are closed. In simpler terms, trades get executed, but the pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities are deferred to the next working day. Stock market holidays 2025: Full list Equity markets have a total of 15 trading holidays in 2025, of which 10 have already passed. The remaining 5 are for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti and Dussehra on October 02, Diwali or Laxmi Pujan on October 21, Diwali Balipratipada on October 22, Prakash Gurpurab on November 05, and Christmas on December 25. It should be noted that a special Muhurat Trading session will be conducted on October 21, which marks the beginning of the Hindu Samvat year. The timings of Muhurat Trading have not yet been announced and will be notified in due course. Stock market outlook Indian markets received a big boost from the government following the simplification of the GST regime. Various goods and services will now be taxed under two key rates—5% and 18%—with certain sin and luxury goods placed under a special 40% slab. However, the markets did not reflect much enthusiasm on Thursday as most of the news was already priced in. Benchmark indices experienced a choppy trading session, ending with marginal gains. The broader markets underperformed the benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining by 0.6% each, reflecting a risk-off sentiment among investors toward non-index constituents. Overall, analysts expect Nifty to consolidate in the range of 24,400-25,000 amid stock-specific actions. \"Immediate support is placed at 24,400-24,337 levels, being the confluence of recent lows and the key retracement area. A breach below this range will signal an acceleration of the decline toward the key support area of 24,000-23,800 levels in the coming week,\" Bajaj Broking said in a note.

    "body": "NSE, BSE To Conduct 1-Hour Diwali Special Trading On October 21 The symbolic trading session will be held between 1:45 pm and 2:45 pm, the stock exchanges said in separate circulars. Read Time: 2 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Last year, the special Muhurat trading session was held from 6 pm to 7 pm. New Delhi: Stock exchanges NSE and BSE will conduct a special Muhurat trading session on Tuesday, October 21, to mark the festival of Diwali, the bourses announced on Monday. The symbolic trading session will be held between 1:45 pm and 2:45 pm, the stock exchanges said in separate circulars. Last year, the special Muhurat trading session was held from 6 pm to 7 pm. The new session also marks the beginning of a new Samvat (Vikram Samvat 2082) -- the Hindu calendar year that starts on Diwali -- and it is believed that trading during the 'Muhurat' or auspicious hour brings prosperity and financial growth for the stakeholders. The market will remain closed for regular trading on Diwali, but a special trading window will be open for one hour. The exchange announced that the pre-opening session will take place from 1:30 pm to 1.45 pm. Market analysts noted that Diwali is considered an auspicious occasion to begin new ventures, and many investors believe participating in the Muhurat trading session brings prosperity throughout the year. However, with the trading window limited to just an hour, the markets often witness heightened volatility. Analysts added that the significance of the session lies more in its symbolic value than in immediate profitability. Trading would take place across various segments like equity, commodity derivatives, currency derivatives, equity futures & options, and securities lending & borrowing (SLB) in the same time slot, according to separate circulars issued by the bourses.

(LTF), one of the leading Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in the country, has announced attractive loan offers for its Two- wheeler Finance customers. The Company has introduced three new offerings, namely, No Cost EMI, Prompt Payment Rebate, and the EMI Lite Festive (buy in 2025, pay in 2026) scheme aiming to provide a fillip to the festive buying spirit. Under the No Cost EMI scheme, customers can finance their purchase without incurring interest charges on the loan amount; the only associated fee is a nominal documentation charge. The Prompt Payment Rebate scheme is available to customers who select a minimum repayment tenure of 36 months, offering a waiver of the final EMI upon successfully repaying the EMIs for 35 months through central clearance. Finally, the EMI Lite Festive scheme allows customers to pay only the interest portion of their EMI for the first two months of the loan term, with no principal amount included in their monthly payment during this initial period, thus making it a buy in 2025 and pay in 2026, making festivals more affordable. Speaking about the new launches, Mr. Sudipta Roy, Managing Director and CEO at LTF, said, “With an advanced version of ‘Project Cyclops’ now live in our Two-wheeler Finance business and the revised GST slabs for bikes and scooters effective this month, we believe this is an opportune time to launch attractive schemes for our customers. Our Two-wheeler Finance business is one of the top three fulcrum products. As one of the leading financiers in this segment, having a prime-dominant portfolio and a best-in-class zero DPD (Days Past Due) record vis-à-vis the industry, we foresee that these offers will drive a substantial surge in demand and strengthen our leadership position.” Mr. Jinesh Shah, Chief Executive – Urban Secured Assets & Third-Party Products at LTF, said, “With over 75 lakh customers served in urban India, we have a profound understanding of the market’s needs. This allowed us to craft a spectacular array of enticing two-wheeler loan offerings that truly benefit our potential customers. Supported by our well- diversified footprint and a network of over 10,000 sourcing points, we are confident that customers will seize this exceptional opportunity to own a two-wheeler and fulfill their aspirations with us as their preferred financier. We anticipate a surge in demand for Two-wheelers given the strong support of lower GST by the government and we are ready for the increased customer inflow at our partner dealer outlets to help fulfill their dreams.” The festive schemes will be valid for customers availing loans until November 30, 2025. In addition, LTF has been offering the best interest rates to deserving customers and offers customers a quick turnaround time of 5 minutes to decide on a loan, aided by a best-in-class digital process wherein no documents are required physically from customers.

The offer was disclosed by Thyssenkrupp AG’s CEO, Miguel López, during a meeting with the company’s Supervisory Board. This marks a potential strategic shift for the European steel sector, as Jindal aims to gain a stronger foothold in the continent. Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe specializes in high-grade flat steel products, including carbon steel, electrical steel, and packaging steel. It operates major facilities in Germany (e.g., Duisburg) and is a key player in green steel initiatives, with products like bluemint®️ (low-CO2 steel). However, the unit has faced ongoing challenges, including high energy costs, global competition, and profitability issues, prompting Thyssenkrupp to seek partners or buyers. Jindal Steel’s Motivation as an Indian steel giant with access to raw materials and expertise in sustainable (“green”) steel production, Jindal sees this acquisition as a way to expand into Europe. It could leverage Thyssenkrupp’s established market presence and technology for low-carbon steel, aligning with global decarbonization trends.

Tuesday’s close at 25,239 confirms a fresh swing high (H), potentially invalidating the earlier lower-high pattern. This move is supported by a higher low (HL) at 24,404 from the August 29 candle, reinforcing the case for sustained momentum. If the index holds above these levels, the previous high at 25,669 now stands as a key resistance. A breakout could pave the way for a fresh higher high (HH) near 25,800. On the downside, 25,150 has flipped into short-term support, while the psychological 25,000 remains a critical cushion for investors. Bank Nifty Outlook Bank Nifty has delivered a strong technical signal, breaking out above the descending broadening wedge’s resistance slope at 54,900—indicating the downtrend from July to September may have ended. After carving out a lower low at 53,561, the index is now trending higher toward the crucial resistance at 56,156, the last lower high. A breakout above this level could mark a decisive long-term trend reversal and boost investor confidence in the banking space. Until then, the possibility of consolidation remains. Key supports are placed at 54,905 (August 8 low) and 54,777 (yesterday’s floor), offering a base for stability. Fundamental Outlook US markets closed on a cautious note yesterday, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision, with uneven employment data fueling uncertainty amid ongoing trade discussions. European equities ended the day lower, shaken by ambiguity surrounding US policy directions and escalating geopolitical concerns that weighed on sentiment. Asian markets opened with a generally subdued performance today, reflecting Wall Street’s hesitance and concerns over potential tariff hikes, though select regions showed resilience. Indian markets are expected to open slightly softer but remain supported by robust domestic sectors like technology and banking, with optimism tied to the Fed’s anticipated actions potentially sparking a recovery. September 17, 2025 08:45 Stock market live today: Morning Market Views by Hariprasad K, Founder - Livelong Wealth Fundamental Views Gift Nifty is hovering around 25,300, hinting at a positive to flat start. However, global cues remain cautious as Wall Street closed lower ahead of the US Fed’s policy announcement. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver its first rate cut of 2025, but investors are closely watching for guidance on further easing. Asian markets opened lower, mirroring the global wait-and-watch sentiment. Volatility remains muted with India VIX at 10.27, suggesting low fear in the market. Dreamfolks Services will be in focus after announcing the discontinuation of airport lounge services in India, a move expected to have a material business impact Technical Views Nifty 50 closed at 25,239, continuing to display strong short-term bullish momentum as the index trades above both its 9-day and 15-day EMAs. A bullish crossover, with EMA 9 crossing above EMA 15 which further strengthens the upside view. Momentum Indicators are also confirming this uptrend. RSI stands at 63.84, firmly in the bullish zone but still shy of the overbought threshold (70+), indicating room for further upside. MACD remains positive with the line above its signal line and a green histogram, reflecting strong buying momentum. Price has also broken above a key descending trendline, confirming a bullish breakout. September 17, 2025 08:45 Stock market live today: Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities on today’s market outlook Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Nifty appears bullish ahead of the widely expected 25-basis point Fed rate cut on 17 September, with the street already positioning for the move. The benchmark index looks set to extend its constructive rally into Diwali and the New Year, supported by a series of Fed cuts. Technically, strength will be confirmed only above 25,670 (high of 30 June), with key support at the 21-DMA of 24,853. The bias remains risk-on as long as Nifty holds above 24,853. Bullish charts include HBL Engineering, JSW Energy, and Prestige Estate. Top pick: HBL Engineering (CMP 909), buy at 890–900, stop 833, targets 923/953 and 1,150. September 17, 2025 08:44 Stock recommendations: Nomura’s coverage on Prestige Estates Projects with a ‘Buy’ and target price of Rs 1,900 Doing all things right: Transforming into a pan-India player, while building a solid annuity-plus-hotel portfolio Action: Initiate coverage at Buy with a target price of INR1,900, implying 17% upside. We initiate coverage on Prestige Estates Projects with Buy rating, as: 1) we believe the company’s pan-India growth strategy is superior to peers, and a strong scale-up is likely, particularly in Mumbai and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), driven by both mid-income township and luxury projects; 2) superior execution should help scale PEPL’s annuity and hotel EBITDA 4-5x over the next 4-5 years; and 3) cheaper valuations given the stock currently trades at a ~40% premium to NAV, lower than Godrej Properties (Reduce; pan-India player with similar pre-sales) at 108%. Moreover, we believe PEPL will beat FY26E pre-sales guidance of ~INR260bn by +10%, with upside risk. Our TP of INR1,900 is based on SOTP (Fig. 52). Downside risks: a slowdown in the Bangalore real estate ( RE) market or weaker-than-expected leasing of annuity assets.

    "body": "As investors and traders prepare for the last trading session of the week, there is confusion about whether the stock markets - National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE - are open or closed today. This is because banks will remain closed in some parts of the country today, i.e. on September 5, 2025. According to the Reserve Bank of India's list of holidays, both public and private sector banks will remain closed on this day due to Eid-e-Milad un-Nabi and Thiruvonam (Onam) festivals. Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi or Id-E-Milad, which marks the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad. Thiruvonam marks the last day of the auspicious Hindu festival of Onam, which is celebrated with great pomp in various regions of South India. Are Stock Markets Open Or Closed Today? While banks are closed in some states, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE will remain open today.
