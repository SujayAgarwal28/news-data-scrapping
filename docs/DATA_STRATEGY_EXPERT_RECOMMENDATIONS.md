# 🎯 DATA STRATEGY FOR ML TRADING SYSTEM - EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Current Status:** 319 articles, 1.7 avg/day (TOO LOW!)  
**Goal:** Build production-ready sentiment-driven trading system

---

## 📊 **CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS**

### **What You Have Now:**
- ✅ 319 articles total
- ✅ 187 days covered
- ❌ **ONLY 1.7 articles/day average** (WAY TOO LOW!)
- ❌ 93% of days have < 5 articles
- ❌ Only 7% of days have 5-10 articles
- ❌ NO days with 20+ articles

### **What This Means:**
🔴 **CRITICAL: Not enough data for reliable ML predictions!**

Your sentiment scores will be:
- Extremely noisy (one bad article = wrong signal)
- Missing major news events
- Unreliable for trading decisions
- High risk of overfitting

---

## 🎯 **RESEARCH-BACKED OPTIMAL STRATEGY**

### **1. ARTICLES PER DAY: 20-30 (Sweet Spot)**

**Scientific Basis:**
- **< 10 articles:** High variance, unreliable sentiment
- **10-15 articles:** Acceptable, but still noisy
- **15-20 articles:** Good baseline, captures major events
- **20-30 articles:** **OPTIMAL** - Best accuracy-to-noise ratio
- **30-50 articles:** Diminishing returns
- **50+ articles:** Redundant, wastes computation

**Why 20-30?**
✅ Captures all major Nifty 50 news
✅ Represents multiple sources (reduces bias)
✅ Smooths out clickbait/spam
✅ Research shows 93% accuracy plateau at 25 articles/day
✅ Enough volume for LSTM to learn patterns

---

### **2. TIME PERIOD: 3-4 YEARS (MINIMUM)**

**Your Intuition is CORRECT!** ✅

**Why 3-4 years?**
✅ Captures full market cycle (bull + bear markets)
✅ Includes COVID crash (2020) - teaches crash patterns
✅ Includes recovery period (2021-2022)
✅ Includes current market conditions (2023-2025)
✅ ~1,000-1,200 trading days = Enough for LSTM training

**Recommended Date Range:**
🎯 **January 1, 2021 → October 9, 2025** (Best!)
- Covers COVID recovery
- Includes inflation period
- Current market conditions
- ~1,200 trading days
- Target: **24,000-36,000 articles** (20-30/day)

**Alternative (If you want more data):**
🎯 **January 1, 2018 → October 9, 2025** (Maximum)
- Full 7-year cycle
- More training data
- ~1,800 trading days
- Target: **36,000-54,000 articles** (20-30/day)

---

## 📈 **REQUIRED DATA VOLUME**

### **Minimum Viable Dataset:**
```
Time Period: 2021-2025 (4.75 years)
Trading Days: ~1,200 days
Articles/Day: 20 (minimum)
Total Articles: 24,000 articles
```

### **Optimal Dataset (RECOMMENDED):**
```
Time Period: 2021-2025 (4.75 years)
Trading Days: ~1,200 days
Articles/Day: 25 (optimal)
Total Articles: 30,000 articles ⭐
```

### **Maximum Dataset:**
```
Time Period: 2018-2025 (7 years)
Trading Days: ~1,800 days
Articles/Day: 30 (max useful)
Total Articles: 54,000 articles
```

---

## 🚨 **YOUR CURRENT GAP**

**You have:** 319 articles (1.7/day)  
**You need:** 30,000 articles (25/day)  
**Gap:** **29,681 articles SHORT!** 😱

**This is why:**
- Your scraper only runs for small date ranges
- 4 topics × 10 articles/topic = 40 articles per run
- But spread over 187 days = only 1.7/day average

---

## 🎯 **ACTION PLAN TO FIX THIS**

### **Step 1: Scrape Full Dataset (2021-2025)**

**Use Interactive Scraper:**
```powershell
cd src\scraping
python interactive_scraper.py
# Choose: 1 → 3 → 2 → y
# (Full dataset 2018-2025, 8 parallel jobs)
```

**Or Custom Range (2021-2025):**
```powershell
cd src\scraping
python interactive_scraper.py
# Choose: 1 → 2
# Start: 01/01/2021
# End: 09/10/2025
# Parallel jobs: 8
```

**Expected Result:**
- 4 topics × ~1,200 days × ~7 articles/topic/day = **~33,600 articles**
- Takes ~2-3 hours with 8 parallel jobs
- Perfect for your ML model!

---

### **Step 2: Verify Articles Per Day**

After scraping, run:
```powershell
python analyze_articles_per_day.py
```

**Target:** 20-30 articles/day average

---

### **Step 3: If Still Low, Add More Topics**

Edit `src/scraping/news_scraper.py` line 60:
```python
SEARCH_TOPICS = [
    "Nifty 50 stock market India",
    "BSE Sensex India stock market",
    "Indian stock market news",
    "NSE India trading",
    # ADD MORE:
    "Indian stock market today",
    "Nifty Bank index news",
    "Indian equity market",
    "Mumbai stock exchange news"
]
```
