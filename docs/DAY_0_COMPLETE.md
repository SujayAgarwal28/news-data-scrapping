### 3. **Established Workflow**

**How You'll Work:**

1. **Check MASTER_TRACKER.md** every morning
   - See what tasks are planned for today
   - Review yesterday's accomplishments

2. **Complete tasks** from the day's checklist
   - Write code in appropriate `src/` subdirectory
   - Store data in `data/` folders
   - Save outputs in `outputs/`

3. **Update MASTER_TRACKER.md** every evening
   - ✅ Check off completed tasks
   - Add remarks (what worked, what didn't, lessons learned)
   - Note any deviations or issues
   - Update "Actual Completion" date

4. **Use 30_DAY_SPRINT_PLAN.md** for technical reference
   - Code examples
   - Architecture details
   - Best practices

5. **Follow DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md** when building UI
   - Page layouts
   - Component designs
   - Color schemes

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### ✅ **Single Source of Truth**
- **MASTER_TRACKER.md** is the ONE file for progress tracking
- No more scattered documentation
- Daily updates with remarks

### ✅ **Clean Structure**
- Everything has its place
- No loose files in root directory
- Easy to find and organize

### ✅ **Professional Presentation**
- Dashboard-first approach (Streamlit)
- 6 comprehensive pages showing all work
- Suitable for stakeholder demos

### ✅ **Focused Scope**
- Skip Twitter/Reddit (noise reduction)
- Use LLM summarization (brilliant idea!)
- Focus on quality over quantity

## 🔄 Daily Workflow Example

**Every Day (Example: Day 1 - Oct 9, 2025):**

### Morning (9:00 AM):
1. Open `MASTER_TRACKER.md`
2. Read Day 1-2 tasks:
   - Review existing scraper
   - Integrate newspaper3k
   - Test on 20 articles
   - Move to `src/scraping/`
3. Check 30_DAY_SPRINT_PLAN.md for code examples

### During Day:
1. Write code in `src/scraping/news_scraper.py`
2. Test on sample articles
3. Save output to `data/raw/news/`
4. Commit to git frequently

### Evening (8:00 PM):
1. Open `MASTER_TRACKER.md`
2. Update Day 1-2 section:
   - ✅ Check off completed tasks
   - **Actual Completion:** Oct 9, 2025
   - **Remarks:** "Newspaper3k works great! Economic Times extracts perfectly, but Moneycontrol needed custom logic. Processing 20 articles took 3 minutes."
3. Save and commit

### Repeat for 30 days!

## 🎨 The Big Picture

### What You're Building:

**Input:** News articles (messy, clickbait headlines, long bodies)  
↓  
**Process 1:** LLM summarizes to 5-10 key points (signal extraction)  
↓  
**Process 2:** FinBERT analyzes sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)  
↓  
**Process 3:** LSTM predicts Nifty 50 movement (4-7 days ahead)  
↓  
**Process 4:** LLM generates human-readable report (with reasoning)  
↓  
**Output 1:** Daily PDF/HTML report  
**Output 2:** Trading signals to StockPass bot  
**Output 3:** Dashboard showing everything  

### Timeline:
- **Days 1-7:** Get clean data (scraping + summarization)
- **Days 8-14:** Extract sentiment (FinBERT)
- **Days 15-21:** Predict prices (LSTM + backtesting)
- **Days 22-30:** Automate & present (dashboard + integration)

### End Result:
A **fully automated system** that:
- Runs every morning at 8:00 AM
- Analyzes news, predicts Nifty 50 movement
- Generates beautiful reports
- Executes paper trades
- Shows everything on a professional dashboard

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Documentation:
- **Update MASTER_TRACKER.md daily** - This is crucial!
- **Add remarks liberally** - Future you will thank you
- **Be honest about issues** - Track what didn't work

### Code Organization:
- **Keep src/ clean** - One module per file
- **Use meaningful names** - `summarizer.py`, not `utils.py`
- **Add docstrings** - Explain what functions do

### Data Management:
- **Use consistent formats** - JSON for structured data
- **Add timestamps** - Know when data was created
- **Compress old data** - Save disk space

### Git Commits:
- **Commit often** - Every logical unit of work
- **Meaningful messages** - "Add body extraction to scraper" not "Update"
- **Don't commit secrets** - .gitignore protects you
